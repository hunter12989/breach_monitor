In 2012, a massive data breach occurred on the Chinese e-commerce website Zouxiu.net, exposing the personal information of 239,186 registered users. The leaked data included sensitive information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and order histories.\n\nThe breach was attributed to a vulnerability in the websites SQL injection protection, which allowed attackers to execute malicious queries and access the websites database. The leaked data was then published on an underground forum and widely distributed online.
