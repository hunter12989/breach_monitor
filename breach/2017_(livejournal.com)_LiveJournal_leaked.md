In 2017, a massive data breach affecting LiveJournal, a popular online blogging platform, was discovered. The breach resulted in the exposure of 263,727,81 records belonging to LiveJournal users.\n\nThe leaked data included a wide range of sensitive information, such as user account names, email addresses, IP addresses, and plaintext passwords, as well as detailed user profiles containing personal information like dates of birth, locations, and interests. The leak posed a significant security risk to LiveJournal users, as the exposed passwords could potentially be used to compromise their accounts on other online services. \n \n The breach was attributed to a flaw in LiveJournals password hashing algorithm, which allowed attackers to easily recover plaintext passwords from the leaked data. LiveJournal subsequently reset all user passwords and implemented stronger security measures to prevent future breaches.
