In 2019, Read Novel (阅文), a Chinese online literature platform, experienced a massive data leak that compromised the personal information of over 22.4 million users. The leaked data included usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, along with other sensitive information.\n\nThe leak was believed to have originated from an internal server at Read Novel. Researchers discovered the exposed database on a publicly accessible Amazon cloud server, which had been misconfigured and left unsecured. The database contained a total of 22424472 records, making it one of the largest data breaches in the history of online literature.\n\nThe leak posed a significant threat to Read Novels users, as it could enable malicious actors to engage in phishing, identity theft, and other fraudulent activities. The company responded to the incident by taking the affected server offline and launching an investigation. Read Novel also notified the relevant authorities and affected users about the leak.
