In March 2020, Indonesias largest e-commerce platform, Tokopedia, suffered a massive data breach that compromised the personal information of over 71 million users.\n\nThe leaked data included usernames, email addresses, full names, gender, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. The breach was discovered by researchers at vpnMentor, a cybersecurity company, who informed Tokopedia of the vulnerability.\n\nTokopedia initially denied the breach, claiming that its systems had not been compromised. However, after vpnMentor released a sample of the stolen data, the company admitted to the breach and apologized to its users.\n\nThe Tokopedia leak is one of the largest data breaches in Indonesian history and has raised concerns about the security of online platforms. The breach has also led to calls for stricter data protection laws in Indonesia.
