In 2017, Edmodo, a popular educational technology platform, experienced a significant data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information belonging to millions of users. The leak, which was discovered by researchers at Comparitech, affected approximately 43 million records, including the names, email addresses, school affiliations, and birthdates of students, teachers, and administrators.\n\nThe breach was attributed to a vulnerability in Edmodos code that allowed unauthorized access to its database. The exposed data was stored in an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket, which did not require authentication to access. This oversight enabled anyone with knowledge of the buckets URL to download and exploit the sensitive user information.
