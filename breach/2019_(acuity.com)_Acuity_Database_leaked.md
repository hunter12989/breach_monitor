In 2019, a massive data breach occurred involving Acuity Scheduling, a popular appointment scheduling software. The breach exposed the personal information of over 241 million individuals, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and appointment details.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found an unsecured database containing the leaked data. The database was accessible without a password and was not protected by any encryption. It is believed that the data was exposed due to a misconfiguration issue on Acuitys server.
