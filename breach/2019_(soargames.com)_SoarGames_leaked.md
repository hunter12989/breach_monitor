SoarGames suffered a data breach in 2019, exposing the personal information of over 5 million users. The leaked data included email addresses, usernames, passwords, and IP addresses. The compromised information was reportedly sold on the dark web for a mere $20.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who alerted SoarGames to the issue. The company subsequently confirmed the breach and reset all user passwords. However, the leaked data has already been circulating online, putting users at risk of phishing attacks and identity theft.
