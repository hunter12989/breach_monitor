The XHamster leak, also known as The Fappening 2, occurred in 2016 and exposed at least 377,377 records of private internet addresses and user information. The leak was caused by a vulnerability in the internet connectivity of various devices used by XHamster users.\n\nOn August 31, 2016, a hacker exploited this vulnerability and gained unauthorized access to XHamsters database, extracting the personal and private information of its users. The stolen data included users IP addresses, email addresses, and other personal details. The hacker then uploaded the stolen data to the dark web, making it publicly available.\n\nThe leaked data not only included private information but also compromising photos, videos, and other personal content. Many users were unaware that their devices were infected with malware, which allowed hackers to access their information. The incident raised concerns about the security and privacy of XHamster users, as well as the potential consequences of storing sensitive information in unsecured databases.\n\n\nXHamster initially downplayed the severity of the leak, but later issued an official statement apologizing for the breach and urging users to change their passwords and be cautious when accessing the site. The incident served as a wake-up call for many online platforms and users, highlighting the importance of maintaining robust security measures to protect personal information.\n
