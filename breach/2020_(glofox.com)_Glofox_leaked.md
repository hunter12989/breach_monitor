In 2020, Glofox experienced a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of over 2.3 million users. This breach involved a third-party vendor who had access to Glofoxs database.\n\nThe leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and payment information. It also contained sensitive information such as gym membership history, fitness goals, and health data. This breach put users at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other forms of cybercrime.\n\nGlofox responded to the breach by launching an investigation and notifying affected users. They also implemented additional security measures to prevent future breaches. However, the leaked data has already been widely distributed on the dark web, making it difficult to mitigate the potential impact on users.
