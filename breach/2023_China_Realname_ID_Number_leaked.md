The leak originated from an unsecured database maintained by a data broker.\n\nThe leaked data included highly sensitive information such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses, social media profiles, and financial details. The breach also exposed unique identifiers, including national identification numbers and drivers license numbers, making individuals vulnerable to identity theft and fraud.\n\nThe data breach was attributed to poor security practices by the data broker.

The incident also highlighted the urgent need for stricter data protection regulations and improved cybersecurity measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access.
