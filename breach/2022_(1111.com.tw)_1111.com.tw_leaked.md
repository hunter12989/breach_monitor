In 2022, a massive data breach occurred at 1111 Job Bank, one of the leading job search platforms in Taiwan. The breach exposed the personal information of 4,757,604 job seekers, including their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, resume content, government-issued identification numbers, and job search preferences.\n\nThe breach was discovered after a researcher noticed that a database containing the personal information of 1111 Job Bank users was publicly accessible on the internet. The researcher alerted the company, which confirmed the breach and took down the database. However, the damage had already been done. The leaked data was quickly spread online and used by cybercriminals to target job seekers with phishing scams and other malicious activities.
