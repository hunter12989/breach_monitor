In 2015, the Indian e-commerce company Gaadi suffered a major data breach, resulting in the leak of 4,261,179 records containing sensitive personal information of its customers. The leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and vehicle registration numbers.\n\nThe breach was caused by a vulnerability in Gaadis third-party vendors system, which allowed unauthorized access to the companys database. The leaked data was then sold on the dark web, exposing millions of Gaadi customers to potential fraud, identity theft, and other cybercrimes.\n\nThe Gaadi leak was one of the largest data breaches in India and raised significant concerns about the security of sensitive personal data in the country. The incident also highlighted the importance of strong data protection measures and the need for companies to thoroughly vet their third-party vendors to prevent future breaches.
