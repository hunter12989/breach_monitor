The No Fly List is a small subset of the U.S. government Terrorist Screening Database (also known as the terrorist watchlist) that contains the identity information of known or suspected terrorists. This database is maintained by the FBIs Terrorist Screening Center. On January 19, 2023, Swiss hacker "maia arson crimew" reported that she had gained access to 2019 versions of the No Fly List stored by CommuteAir on an unsecured cloud server. The leak led to the exposure of data including Full names and Dates of Birth. In total, 1.8 million people were affected. Full credit for this hack goes to "maia arson crimew".\n\nCompromised data: Full names, Dates of Birth
