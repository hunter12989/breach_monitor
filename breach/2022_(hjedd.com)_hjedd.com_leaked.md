In 2022, a massive data breach occurred at Haijiao Community, a Chinese online forum. This incident exposed a staggering 13,407,024 user records, resulting in one of the largest data breaches in recent history. The leaked data included sensitive personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and even government-issued identification numbers. This leak had a significant impact on the privacy and security of the affected individuals.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researchers who analyzed a sample of the leaked data. They found that the information was stored in an insecure database that was accessible without proper authentication. It is believed that a malicious actor exploited a vulnerability in the forums software to gain unauthorized access to the database and exfiltrate the data. The researchers notified the Chinese authorities and Haijiao Community about the breach, and the forum subsequently took steps to secure its systems and prevent further data loss.
