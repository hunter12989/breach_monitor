In March 2021, a data breach at Pionex Crypto Trading exposed the personal information of 241,933 users. The leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and trading information.\n\nThe breach was caused by an unsecured Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket that contained a database of Pionex users. The bucket was left unprotected, allowing anyone with the link to access the data.\n\nThe data breach was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen. Sen notified Pionex of the breach, and the company quickly took action to secure the leaked data. Pionex also notified affected users of the breach and offered them free credit monitoring services.\n\nThe Pionex Crypto Trading leak is a reminder of the importance of data security. Companies that store sensitive user data must take steps to protect that data from unauthorized access.
