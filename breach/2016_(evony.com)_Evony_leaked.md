The Evony leak, which occurred in 2016, exposed the personal information of over 29 million users of the popular browser-based strategy game. The leaked data included email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and in-game purchases.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt, who found the data being sold on a dark web marketplace. Hunt notified Evony of the leak, and the company took down the affected server and reset all user passwords.\n\nThe Evony leak is a reminder of the importance of protecting your personal information online. When you sign up for an account, always use a strong password and be careful about what information you share.
