In 2020, the fitness tracking app Jefit suffered a major data breach exposing personal information of its users. The leak compromised a staggering 9,052,457 records, making it one of the largest data breaches in the fitness industry.\n\nThe leaked data included sensitive information such as names, email addresses, hashed passwords, birthdates, gender, height, weight, and fitness goals. The breach also revealed user location data, device information, and even IP addresses. This sensitive information put users at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other forms of cybercrime.\n\nThe Jefit leak was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who alerted the company to the vulnerability. Jefit promptly acknowledged the breach and implemented measures to secure its systems, including resetting user passwords and implementing additional security protocols. However, the damage had already been done, and the leaked data had been circulating online for several weeks.
