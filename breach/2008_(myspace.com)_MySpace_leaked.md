In 2008, MySpace experienced a major data breach that compromised the personal information of nearly 360 million users. This breach occurred when a vulnerability in the sites code allowed hackers to scrape and download the data of almost every MySpace user at the time.\n\nThe leaked data included a wide range of information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, gender, and location. In addition, the breach exposed the personal messages and photos of millions of users. The leaked data was subsequently posted on various websites and forums, making it widely accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
