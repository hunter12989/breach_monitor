In 2012, a massive data breach at Taobao, Chinas largest e-commerce platform, resulted in the leak of over 15 million customer records. The breach exposed sensitive information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The leak was traced to a vulnerability in Taobaos user database, which allowed unauthorized access to customer data.\n\nThe leak had a significant impact on Taobaos reputation and led to widespread concern about data security in China. In the aftermath of the breach, Taobao implemented stricter security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The company also faced legal consequences, with several lawsuits filed against it by affected customers.
