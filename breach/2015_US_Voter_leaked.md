In 2015, a massive data breach compromised the voter registration records of over 152 million Americans, exposing sensitive personal information. The leak included names, addresses, dates of birth, political affiliations, and voting histories.\n\nThe source of the leak was a vendor, Verity, that had been hired by states to maintain their voter registration systems. Verity stored the data on an unsecured server that was accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The breach was discovered by security researchers who found the exposed data while conducting routine scans.\n\nThe US Voter leak was one of the largest data breaches in history and raised serious concerns about the security of sensitive personal information. The breach exposed Americans to the risk of identity theft, fraud, and other crimes. It also undermined public trust in the integrity of the electoral process.
