The Chatbooks data leak, which occurred in 2020, compromised the personal information of millions of users. The leaked records included names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data. In total, the breach exposed over 2.5 million user records.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery, who found that the data was being exposed through an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. It is believed that the data leak was caused by a misconfiguration on Chatbooks part, which left the bucket publicly accessible without any password protection.\n\nThe leaked data was quickly picked up by criminals and used for phishing attacks and other malicious purposes. Chatbooks responded to the leak by resetting user passwords and launching an investigation. They also notified affected users and offered them free credit monitoring services.
