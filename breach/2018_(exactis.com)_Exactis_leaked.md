In 2018, a data breach at Exactis exposed the personal information of over 131 million Americans. The leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and even political affiliations. The compromised data was obtained from a variety of sources, including public records, social media, and commercial databases.\n\nThe Exactis leak was one of the largest data breaches in history. It exposed the sensitive personal information of a vast number of Americans, and it raised serious concerns about the privacy and security of our personal data. In the wake of the breach, Exactis was fined $1.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission and was forced to take steps to improve its data security practices.
