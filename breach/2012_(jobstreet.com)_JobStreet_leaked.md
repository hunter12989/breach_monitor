In 2012, JobStreet, one of the largest job portals in Malaysia, suffered a massive data leak. The incident involved the unauthorized access to and theft of a significant number of user records, including sensitive personal information. Its believed that around 16,305,055 records were compromised, making it one of the largest data breaches in the countrys history.\n\nThe leaked data included users personal details such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and even passwords, which were stored in plaintext. This meant that hackers had direct access to sensitive information, allowing them to use it for malicious purposes such as identity theft, phishing, or other fraudulent activities.\n\nThe leak was reportedly discovered by security researchers, who alerted JobStreet to the issue. Unfortunately, the company didnt respond promptly, and it took several weeks for the job portal to acknowledge the breach and take measures to contain it. The incident led to widespread concerns among users, who were left wondering how their personal data was compromised and how the company would prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\nAn investigation into the breach was launched, but the exact details of how the hack occurred and who was responsible remain unclear. Nonetheless, the JobStreet data leak served as a wake-up call for companies to prioritize cybersecurity and protect their users sensitive information.
