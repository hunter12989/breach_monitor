The Emuparadise leak occurred in 2018 and was one of the largest data breaches to date. On April 14, 2018, a Russian hacker group calling themselves  Farebek Group leaked over 1,131,229 records from Emuparadise, a popular retro game and emulator download site. The leaked data included user information such as names, email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, and other sensitive information.\n\nThe hackers claimed to have obtained the data by exploiting a vulnerability in Emuparadises database. The leaked records were subsequently posted on a dark web forum, allowing any individual with access to the forum to view and download the sensitive information.\n\nThe breach affected over 1 million users of Emuparadise, and it was reportedly one of the largest breaches of its kind at the time. The incident highlighted the importance of securing user data and the potential consequences of failing to do so.
