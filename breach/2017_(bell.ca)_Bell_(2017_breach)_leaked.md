On June 24, 2017, a massive data breach occurred at Bell Canada, exposing the personal information of over 2.2 million customers. The breach was discovered when a security researcher found a publicly accessible database containing the stolen data.\n\nThe leaked records included a wide range of personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and account numbers. The breach also exposed the records of some Bell employees.\n\nThe breach is believed to have been caused by a vulnerability in Bells website. The vulnerability allowed attackers to access the database and steal the customer data.\n\nBell has since taken steps to fix the vulnerability and improve its security measures. The company has also notified affected customers and offered them credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.\n\nThe Bell data breach is a reminder of the importance of strong data security measures. Businesses need to take steps to protect customer data from unauthorized access.
