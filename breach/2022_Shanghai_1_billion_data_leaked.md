In 2022, a massive data breach occurred in Shanghai, exposing the personal information of over 1 billion Chinese citizens.\n\nThe leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, and personal identification numbers of Chinese citizens. It was sold on the dark web for $10 billion, making it one of the largest and most expensive data breaches in history.\n\nThe breach was traced back to a Shanghai-based company that had been collecting and selling personal data without the consent of the individuals involved. The companys servers were hacked, and the data was stolen and sold to the highest bidder.
