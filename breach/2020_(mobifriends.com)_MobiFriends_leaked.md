The MobiFriends leak in 2020 was a significant data breach that affected the online dating app MobiFriends. The breach occurred in 2017 but was not discovered until 2020.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, a hacker claimed to have stolen 3687344 user records from MobiFriends. The breached data included first and last names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The hacker also claimed to have obtained 227972 additional user records, which included information such as date of birth, location, and password hashes.\n\nThe breach was significant not only due to the number of affected users but also because the hacker sent samples of the stolen data to various media outlets to prove the extent of the breach. MobiFriends denied the breach initially but later acknowledged it, stating that they had notified users affected by the breach and were taking steps to prevent future breaches.\n\nThe breach highlighted the importance of online security and the need for companies to protect user data. It also prompted MobiFriends to upgrade its security measures and implement new protocols to prevent similar breaches in the future.
