In 2013, JD (formerly known as Jingdong), a prominent Chinese e-commerce company, suffered a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of over 140 million users. The leaked data included sensitive information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and hashed passwords, making it one of the largest data breaches in Chinas history.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researchers who noticed a large file containing user data being shared on a popular file-sharing platform. The leaked file contained user records from JDs website, mobile app, and third-party platforms where JD had integrated its services. The breach had a significant impact on JDs reputation and resulted in an investigation by the Chinese authorities.
