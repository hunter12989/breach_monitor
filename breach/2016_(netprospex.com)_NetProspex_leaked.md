In 2016, NetProspex, a B2B data provider, experienced a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of individuals. The leak, which was discovered in May of that year, compromised over 33 million records, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a vulnerability in NetProspexs website that allowed unauthorized access to its database. The exposed data was stored in an unsecured format, making it easily accessible to attackers. The breach was not publicly disclosed by NetProspex until several months after it was discovered, raising concerns about the companys security practices and its handling of sensitive information.
