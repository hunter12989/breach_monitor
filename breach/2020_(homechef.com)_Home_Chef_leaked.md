In 2020, Home Chef suffered a severe data breach that exposed the personal information of 8,717,764 customers. The compromised records included customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and order histories.\n\nThe breach was caused by a third-party vendor that stored customer data on a server that was not properly secured. The vendor, which was never identified, was used by Home Chef to process orders and send out marketing emails. When the server was breached, the hackers gained access to the customer data stored on it.
