In 2018, a massive data breach occurred at Adapt, a company that provides software to healthcare providers. The breach exposed the records of over 9.3 million individuals. The leaked data included sensitive information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, medical diagnoses, and treatment plans.\n\nThe breach was caused by a flaw in Adapts software that allowed unauthorized users to access the companys database. Once inside, the attackers were able to download the entire database, which contained the personal and medical information of millions of people.\n\nThe Adapt leak was one of the largest breaches in history and had a significant impact on the individuals whose data was stolen. Many people were worried about their privacy and the potential for identity theft and other forms of fraud. Adapt has since taken steps to improve its security and prevent future breaches.
