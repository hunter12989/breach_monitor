In 2017, a data breach at the AI.type keyboard app exposed the personal information of over 2 million users. The leaked data included email addresses, phone numbers, and text messages, as well as sensitive information such as social security numbers and credit card numbers.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery, who found a database containing the leaked data on an unprotected server. The database contained over 20 million records, of which 2,058,006 contained personally identifiable information.\n\nThe AI.type breach is a reminder of the importance of protecting personal data. Users should be careful about what information they share with apps and websites, and they should make sure to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect their accounts.
