In 2011, a massive data breach at marketing firm Epsilon leaked the personal information of over 96 million Americans. The breach exposed Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and email addresses, making it one of the largest data leaks in history.\n\nThe breach occurred when an intruder accessed Epsilons network and exploited a vulnerability in their system. The attacker then downloaded a database containing the personal information of millions of Epsilons customers. The breach was not discovered for several months, allowing the attacker to sell the data on the black market.\n\nThe Epsilon data leak had a significant impact on the victims. Many people had their identities stolen, and their financial accounts were compromised. The breach also damaged Epsilons reputation and led to numerous lawsuits.
