The Yatra leak, occurring in 2013, compromised the personal information of 5,033,997 users of the Indian online travel agency, Yatra.com. This massive data breach exposed sensitive details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The leak also revealed the account type, frequent flier number, and internal travel ID of the affected individuals.\n\nThe exposed data was reportedly obtained by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Yatras website. The leaked information was then distributed and sold on the dark web, raising concerns about identity theft, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities. The incident was a significant setback for the companys reputation and highlighted the need for robust data security measures in the travel industry.
