In August 2012, security researcher Jeremiah Grossman discovered a vulnerability in Disqus, a popular commenting platform, that exposed sensitive user data. The vulnerability allowed attackers to access the sites database and steal user information, including email addresses, IP addresses, and passwords.\n\nGrossman responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Disqus, which quickly patched the issue. However, before the patch could be applied, attackers had already exploited the vulnerability and stolen a massive trove of user data. The leak affected over 17 million users, making it one of the largest data breaches in history.\n\nThe stolen data was subsequently published on the Internet, where it was used by criminals to launch phishing attacks and spam campaigns. The leak also raised concerns about the security of online commenting platforms and the need for users to protect their personal information online.
