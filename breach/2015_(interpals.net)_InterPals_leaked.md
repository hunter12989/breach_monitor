The InterPals leak, which occurred in 2015, was a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of users. On December 31, 2015, hackers compromised InterPals database, gaining unauthorized access to its servers.\n\nAs a result, approximately 3,450,450 records were leaked, including the names, email addresses, usernames, and passwords of InterPals users. The leaked database also contained more detailed information for some users, such as birthdates, gender, and country of residence.\n\nThe hack was particularly concerning because InterPals is a social networking site that allows users to connect with each other in order to practice language skills. This means that many of the users who were affected by the breach likely had their personal information exposed to potentially malicious actors.
