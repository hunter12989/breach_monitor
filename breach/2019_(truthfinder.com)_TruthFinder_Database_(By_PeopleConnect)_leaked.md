However, the unsecured nature of the database allowed unauthorized access, leading to the massive data leak. \n\nThe TruthFinder leak raised serious concerns about the privacy and security of personal data held by data brokers. It highlighted the need for stronger data protection laws and regulations to prevent such breaches from occurring in the future.
