In 2013, a massive data breach at Chinese social media company Momo resulted in the exposure of highly sensitive information belonging to millions of its users. An estimated 2,100,234 records were compromised, making it one of the largest data leaks in history.\n\nThe leaked data included a wide range of personal information such as names, gender, age, email addresses, phone numbers, and location data. However, the most alarming aspect of the breach was the disclosure of sexually explicit images and videos uploaded by Momo users. This sensitive content was accessible to anyone who had access to the leaked database.
