In 2019, Malindo Air, a Malaysian low-cost airline, experienced a significant data breach that compromised the personal information of over 45 million passengers. The leaked database contained a vast amount of data, including names, email addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, and travel itineraries.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researchers in May 2019, and Malindo Air confirmed the incident shortly after. The company stated that the data leak was caused by a vulnerability in its website, which allowed unauthorized access to the database. Malindo Air immediately took steps to secure the website and launched an investigation into the breach.
