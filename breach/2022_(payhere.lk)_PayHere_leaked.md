The PayHere leak in 2022 refers to a data breach that occurred in August 2022, which exposed a massive amount of sensitive information. The breach compromised a total of 1,580,249 records.\n\nThe leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing addresses, and payment card details. The payment card information included card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes. This is considered extremely sensitive information and can be used for fraudulent activities, such as identity theft and financial theft.\n\nThe breach was attributed to a vulnerability in PayHeres online payment processing system. Hackers were able to exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system and extract the sensitive information. PayHere later announced that they had detected the breach and were working to contain the damage and prevent further exploitation.\n\nThe leak has raised concerns about the security of online payment systems and the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive information.
