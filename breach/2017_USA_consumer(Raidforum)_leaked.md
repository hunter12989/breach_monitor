In 2017, a massive data breach occurred on the Raidforum, a popular dark web marketplace. The breach exposed the personal information of over 3.6 million Americans, including their names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and birth dates. The breach was attributed to a vulnerability in the websites software, which allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to the database.\n\nThe data was sold on the dark web for $15,000, and it was quickly used by criminals to commit fraud and identity theft. The breach also raised concerns about the security of personal data stored by companies and government agencies. In the aftermath of the breach, the U.S. government launched an investigation, and the websites owner was arrested. However, many of the victims of the breach have yet to receive compensation for the damages they suffered.
