In 2023, the Zurich branch of Japan Bank became the victim of a major data breach, compromising the sensitive information of over 2.6 million customers. The leak included a vast array of personal and financial data, such as names, addresses, account numbers, and transaction histories.\n\nThe breach was discovered when an unauthorized party gained access to the banks internal systems, exploiting a vulnerability in the network. The stolen data was then posted on a dark web forum, making it accessible to cybercriminals and other malicious actors.\n\nThe Zurich Japan Bank branch leak had a devastating impact on its customers, with many facing the threat of identity theft, financial fraud, and other cybercrimes. The bank faced severe criticism for its failure to adequately protect its customers data and has since implemented enhanced security measures to prevent future breaches.
