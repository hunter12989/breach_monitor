The GSMHosting Database leak occurred in 2016 and exposed the personal information of over 2.6 million users of the GSMHosting forum, a popular online platform for mobile phone unlocking and repair.\n\nThe leaked database contained sensitive information such as usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and passwords, as well as detailed information about users mobile devices, including IMEI numbers and phone models. The leak was attributed to a vulnerability in the forums software, which allowed unauthorized access to the user database.
