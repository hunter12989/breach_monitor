In 2013, a massive data breach occurred at Huazhu Hotels Group, a Chinese hotel chain. The breach resulted in the exposure of 20,048,903 guest records, including personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The leaked data also contained details of guest stays, including check-in and checkout dates, room numbers, and payment information.\n\nThe breach was discovered by a security researcher who found a misconfigured server that allowed anyone to access the exposed data without authentication. The researcher notified Huazhu Hotels about the vulnerability, and the company subsequently secured the server. However, the data breach had already exposed millions of guest records to potential misuse.
