The btech.com leak, reported in 2023, has compromised approximately 187,750 records. The leaked data includes both national and international student information, along with educational credentials and other sensitive details.\n\nThe affected individuals are presumably students who have applied or are currently enrolled at institutions with partnership agreements with btech.com. This could include international students studying or pursuing higher education abroad.\n\nThe leaked records are said to contain students personal information, such as names, contact details, and educational credentials, including diplomas and degrees. Additionally, the leak may include biometric data, identification numbers, and authentication tokens.\n\nThe breach is believed to have occurred due to a vulnerability in the online application portal used by btech.com to manage student admissions and enrollments. Once identified, the vulnerability was exploited, resulting in the unauthorized access and theft of sensitive student data.\n\nAs a result, btech.com has faced severe criticism and reputational damage. The organization has undertaken immediate measures to contain the breach, including notifying affected students and implementing enhanced security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe leaked data, if acquired by malicious actors, could be used for nefarious purposes, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or stalking and harassment.
