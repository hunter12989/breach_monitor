In July 2018, Zoomcar, an Indian car-sharing company, suffered a data leak that compromised the personal information of 3,589,795 users. The leaked data included email addresses, IP addresses, real names, passwords, and phone numbers.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia, who found a database containing the leaked data on an unsecured server. The data was reportedly stolen by hackers who exploited a vulnerability in Zoomcars website.\n\nThe data leak was a major security breach for Zoomcar, and it exposed the sensitive personal information of millions of its users. The company has since taken steps to improve its security, but the leak has raised concerns about the security of online platforms and the privacy of personal data.
