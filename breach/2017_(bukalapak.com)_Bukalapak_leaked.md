The Bukalapak data leak in 2017 was a major cybersecurity breach that exposed the personal information of millions of users. The leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other sensitive information. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in Bukalapaks website that allowed hackers to access the companys database.\n\nThe leaked data was sold on the dark web and used by criminals to commit identity theft, fraud, and other crimes. The breach had a significant impact on Bukalapaks reputation and resulted in the company being fined by the Indonesian government. Bukalapak has since taken steps to improve its security and prevent future breaches.
