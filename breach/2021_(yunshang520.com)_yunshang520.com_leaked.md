In 2021, a major data breach occurred at Tianji Ecommerce (天九云商), a Chinese e-commerce company. The breach exposed the personal information of 45,185 users, including their names, phone numbers, addresses, and email addresses.\n\nThe leak was discovered by the security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found a publicly accessible database containing the compromised data. The database was not password-protected, allowing anyone with internet access to view the information.\n\nThe breach raised concerns about the security of personal data in China. It is unclear how the leak occurred, but it is believed that hackers may have gained access to Tianjis systems through a vulnerability in the companys website or database.
