In 2015, Edaboard, an electronics engineering forum, suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of its users. The leaked data included 459,213 records, each containing a users email address, username, and password. The breach was discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt, who found the data being sold on a dark web marketplace. Hunt notified Edaboard of the breach, and the company subsequently reset all user passwords and implemented additional security measures.
