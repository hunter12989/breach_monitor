On February 21, 2023, a data breach at Sphero, a company that produces robotic toys, resulted in the exposure of personal information belonging to 832,255 individuals. The leaked data included names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth.\n\nThe cause of the breach is believed to be a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket, which allowed unauthorized access to the data. Sphero has since secured the bucket and launched an investigation into the incident. The company has also notified affected individuals and is offering free credit monitoring services.
