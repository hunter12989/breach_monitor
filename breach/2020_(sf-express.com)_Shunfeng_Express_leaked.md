In 2020, a massive data breach at Shunfeng Express, a Chinese logistics company, exposed the personal information of over 65 million customers. The leak included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, ID card numbers, and even bank account details.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a vulnerability in Shunfengs Expresss website, which allowed an unauthorized party to access its customer database. The leaked data was then sold on the dark web, posing a significant risk of identity theft and fraud to the affected individuals.
