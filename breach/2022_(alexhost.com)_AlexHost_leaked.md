In March 2022, a data breach at AlexHost exposed the records of over 1515 users. The leaked data included email addresses, hashed passwords, and other personal information.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Ankit Anubhav when he found a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket that contained the exposed data. The bucket was publicly accessible and unprotected, allowing anyone with an internet connection to view the data. \n\nAlexHost has since fixed the configuration issue and secured the affected bucket. The company has also notified affected users and recommended that they change their passwords.
