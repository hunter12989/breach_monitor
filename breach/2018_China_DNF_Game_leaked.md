In 2018, a massive data leak compromised the personal information of over 7.3 million players of the popular online game Dungeon and Fighter (DNF) in China.\n\nThe leaked data included usernames, real names, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, exposing players to potential phishing attacks, identity theft, and other cybercrimes.\n\nThe leak was traced back to a vulnerability in the games account creation process, which allowed attackers to access the database and extract user information. The incident raised concerns about the security of online gaming platforms and the importance of protecting player data.
