In 2022, a major data breach occurred at IndiHome, one of Indonesias largest internet service providers. The breach exposed the personal information of 26,730,798 customers, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The leaked data also included sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers and bank account details.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found the exposed data on an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) server. Diachenko reported the breach to IndiHome, which subsequently took down the server and launched an investigation.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the breach was caused by a misconfigured AWS server. IndiHome admitted that it had not implemented proper security measures to protect the data of its customers. The company apologized for the breach and promised to take steps to improve its security practices.\n\nThe IndiHome data breach is a reminder of the importance of data security. Companies that collect and store sensitive personal information must take steps to protect that data from unauthorized access.
