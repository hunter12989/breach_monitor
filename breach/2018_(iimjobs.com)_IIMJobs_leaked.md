The IIMJobs leak occurred in 2018, which was one of the largest data breaches in Indias history. The database of IIMJobs, a popular job portal for MBA and management students, was compromised, exposing the personal information of approximately 28.6 million users.\n\n\n\n\nThe leaked data included sensitive information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, genders, and passwords, which were stored in plaintext. The passwords were not hashed, making it easy for hackers to access the information. The leak also included additional information such as resume details, interests, and preferences.\n\n\n\n\nThe breach was first reported by a security researcher named Srinivas Kodali, who claimed that he discovered the vulnerability in the IIMJobs database. The researcher alleged that the database was accessible to anyone who knew the correct URL and SQL injection technique.\n\n\n\n\nThe incident sparked widespread outrage and concern among users, particularly students and professionals who trusted IIMJobs with their personal data. The company was criticized for its poor handling of user data and lack of adequate security measures to protect sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation was launched by the Indian government, and several officials were arrested in connection with the breach. The leak highlighted the importance of data protection and security, particularly in the digital age, and led to a renewed focus on cybersecurity and data privacy in India.
