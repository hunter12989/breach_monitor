The MoDaCo leak in 2016 refers to a data breach that occurred on May 20, 2016, where MoDaCo, a popular technology forum, was hacked and 879,703 records were compromised.\n\nAccording to MoDaCos statement, the breach occurred when an unauthorized third-party gained access to their database, stealing user account information including username, email address, password (stored in plaintext), and other sensitive data. The attacker then uploaded the stolen data to a publicdataset on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe leaked data includes a range of information, including user names and passwords, as well as personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, and dates of birth. The data leak primarily affects users who registered on the forum before March 2015, as well as those who accessed the site during the compromised period.\n\nMoDaCo has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the breach, including forcing password resets for affected users, increasing security measures, and cooperating with law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident.
