PeopleDataLabs (PDL) is a data enrichment and lead generation company that collects public data from various sources, including social media, websites, and other online platforms. In May 2019, a massive leak occurred from PDL, exposing a database containing 471,014,406 records. \n\n\nThe leaked database contained a vast amount of personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social media profiles. It also included employment data, education information, and other sensitive data. The leak was caused by a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket, which allowed unauthorized access to the database.
