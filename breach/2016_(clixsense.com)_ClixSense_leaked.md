In 2016, a major data breach occurred on the crowdsourcing platform ClixSense, exposing the personal information of 2,424,784 users. The leaked data included usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe leak was the result of an SQL injection vulnerability in the ClixSense website. This vulnerability allowed attackers to access and download the user database. The breach was discovered by security researcher Vinny Troia, who notified ClixSense of the issue.\n\nClixSense responded to the breach by resetting all user passwords and implementing additional security measures. However, the leaked data is still available online, and it is possible that it will be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes.
