In January 2024, a major data breach occurred in China, compromising the personal information of over one million patients. The leak affected Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, a renowned healthcare institution in Shanghai.\n\nThe breach involved a database containing 1050944 patient records, spanning multiple years from 2019 to 2023. The leaked data included detailed patient information such as:\n\n* Names\n* IDs\n* Birthdates\n* Contact details\n* Medical histories\n* Treatment plans\n* Test results\n* Insurance data\n* Doctors notes\n\nThe leakage was reportedly caused by a vulnerability in the hospitals CRM system, which was identified and exploited by an unknown entity. The affected patients were only notified weeks after the breach, sparking concerns over the delay and potential misuse of their sensitive information.\n\nAs the incident unfolded, Chinese authorities launched an investigation, and multiple individuals, including hospital officials and IT personnel, were held accountable for the breach. In response to the incident, the hospital implemented enhanced security measures and introduced a new data protection system to prevent similar breaches in the future.
