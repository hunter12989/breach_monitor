The China Doctor leak, discovered in 2023, compromised the personal information of over 62,000 Chinese medical professionals. The leaked data included names, job titles, phone numbers, email addresses, and medical license numbers.\n\nThe leak was traced to a third-party vendor that had been hired by a Chinese healthcare company to process medical data. The vendor stored the data on a publicly accessible Amazon Web Services (AWS) server without proper security measures, allowing anyone with internet access to download the information.\n\nThe leak raised concerns about the security of personal data in China and the countrys compliance with data protection regulations. It also highlighted the risks associated with using third-party vendors to handle sensitive information.
