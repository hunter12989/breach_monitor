In March 2018, MyFitnessPal, a popular health and fitness tracking app, experienced a data breach that compromised the personal information of over 144 million users. The leaked data included usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, and other personal information.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a flaw in MyFitnessPals password reset process. Attackers were able to exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. The company later stated that no financial information or sensitive health data was compromised in the breach.\n\nMyFitnessPal responded to the breach by resetting all user passwords and implementing additional security measures. The company also notified affected users and encouraged them to change their passwords on other accounts where they used the same email address and password.
