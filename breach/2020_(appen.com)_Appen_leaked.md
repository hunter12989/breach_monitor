In 2020, Appen, a data annotation company, experienced a significant data leak that exposed the sensitive personal information of numerous individuals. The breach affected over 5.8 million records, compromising a vast amount of private data.\n\nThe leaked information included names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and in some cases, even sensitive medical information. The breach occurred via a security vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to Appens systems, allowing malicious actors to exfiltrate the sensitive data.\n\nThe leak raised serious concerns about the privacy and security of individuals whose data was compromised. Appen faced backlash and criticism for its handling of the incident, and the company was forced to take immediate steps to address the breach and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
