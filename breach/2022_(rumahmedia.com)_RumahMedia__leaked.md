In 2022, RumahMedia, a data broker in Indonesia, suffered a massive data leak, exposing the sensitive personal information of 236,742 individuals. \n \n The leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and even biometric data such as fingerprints. The compromised database was available for purchase on the dark web, posing a significant risk of identity theft and fraud for the affected individuals. \n \n The incident raised concerns about the lack of adequate data protection measures in place at RumahMedia. The company subsequently issued a statement acknowledging the breach and pledged to improve its data security practices. However, the damage had already been done, and the leaked information remained accessible to malicious actors.
