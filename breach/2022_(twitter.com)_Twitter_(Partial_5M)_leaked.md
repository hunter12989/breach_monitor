In December 2022, a massive data leak from Twitter, containing over 5 million user records, was discovered. The leaked information included personal details such as email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, and profile information.\n\nThe breach was traced back to an exploit in Twitters programming interface (API) that allowed unauthorized access to user data. The leaked database, containing records of 5485635 users, was obtained by a hacker and subsequently shared online.
