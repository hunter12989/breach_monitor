On August 15, 2022, a massive data breach at the Chinese online education platform Chao Xing Learning Communication (also known as Superstar Learning) exposed the personal information of over 139 million users. The leaked data includes names, email addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, school affiliations, and academic performance records.\n\nThe breach was discovered by a cybersecurity researcher who found a publicly accessible database containing the sensitive information. The data was allegedly obtained by an employee who had access to the companys internal systems. Chao Xing Learning Communication has since confirmed the breach and notified affected users.
