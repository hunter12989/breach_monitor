In 2023, a widely reported data leak involving the personal information of millions of Thai car insurance policyholders turned out to be a false alarm.\n\nInitial reports suggested that a massive leak had occurred, exposing sensitive data such as names, addresses, ID numbers, and insurance details. However, subsequent investigations by Thai authorities, including the Personal Data Protection Committee (PDPC), revealed that no actual data breach had taken place. The rumored database containing the leaked records was found to be non-existent.\n\nThe PDPC concluded that the alleged leak was likely a case of misinformation or a deliberate attempt to create panic and distrust. The committee emphasized that it takes data protection seriously and will continue to monitor and investigate any reports of data breaches.
