In 2011, a major data breach occurred at Zoosk, an online dating service. The breach compromised the personal information of over 52 million users.\n\nStolen data included usernames, passwords, email addresses, birthdates, genders, religious affiliations, physical addresses, and IP addresses. This sensitive information put users at risk of identity theft, phishing scams, and other cybercrimes. Zoosk was criticized for not adequately protecting user data and failing to notify users of the breach promptly.
