In 2011, a massive data breach occurred, exposing the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF). This confidential database contained highly sensitive information on over 85 million deceased Americans. The leak included full names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and death, making it a treasure trove for identity thieves.\n\nThe breach was traced back to a third-party vendor hired by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to facilitate public records requests. The vendors server was compromised, allowing hackers to access the SSDMF database. The SSA initially reported that only 6.5 million records were affected, but the true extent of the breach was later revealed, affecting millions more individuals.
