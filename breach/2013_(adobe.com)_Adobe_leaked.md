In October 2013, Adobe suffered a massive data breach that compromised the personal information of approximately 152 million users.\n\nThe leaked data included names, email addresses, encrypted passwords, and other sensitive information. It is believed that the attack was carried out by a group of hackers who exploited a vulnerability in Adobes systems.\n\nThe breach was one of the largest in history at the time and had a significant impact on Adobes reputation. The company was forced to reset passwords for all affected users and implement new security measures to prevent future attacks.
