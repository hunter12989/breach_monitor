In 2019, a major data leak occurred at GoNinja, a popular online marketing platform. The breach exposed the personal information of over 5.2 million users, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found a misconfigured database on an unsecured server. The database contained sensitive user data that had been collected by GoNinja over the years. The leaked information was quickly disseminated across the internet, leaving millions of users vulnerable to identity theft, phishing scams, and other cyberattacks.\n\nThe GoNinja data leak is a reminder of the importance of data security and privacy. Businesses must take all necessary steps to protect the personal information of their users, including implementing strong security measures and encrypting sensitive data. Users must also be vigilant about protecting their personal information online and should be wary of sharing it with unknown or untrustworthy entities.
