In January 2023, a data breach affecting JetBrains, the leading software development company behind IntelliJ IDEA and other popular development tools, was discovered. The breach, which was the result of a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket, exposed sensitive information belonging to 30,964 individuals associated with JetBrains.\n\nThe leaked data included full names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, and company names. This information could potentially be used for phishing attacks, identity theft, and other malicious activities. JetBrains has since taken steps to secure the affected S3 bucket and launched an investigation into the incident. They have also notified the affected individuals and recommended that they take appropriate precautions to protect their compromised information.
