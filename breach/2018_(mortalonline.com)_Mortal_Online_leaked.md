In 2018, Mortal Online suffered a significant data breach that led to the exposure of 606,637 user records. The leaked information included sensitive data such as emails, real names, passwords, addresses, and usernames. The breach was later attributed to a vulnerability in the games login system, which allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to the user database. The compromised data was subsequently uploaded to an online forum, where it was made available to the public.
