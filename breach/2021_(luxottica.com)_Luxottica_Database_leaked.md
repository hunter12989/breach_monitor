In 2021, a massive data breach occurred at Luxottica, a global eyewear company. The breach exposed the personal information of over 77 million individuals worldwide.\n\nThe leaked data included names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and purchase history. It also contained sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers and expiration dates. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in Luxotticas IT systems, which allowed unauthorized access to its databases.
