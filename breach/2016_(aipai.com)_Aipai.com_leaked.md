In 2016, a data leak from Aipai.com, a Chinese social media platform, exposed the personal information of over 6.5 million users. The leak included a wide range of sensitive data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and geographic locations.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researchers at the University of Torontos Citizen Lab. The researchers found that the data had been stored in an unsecured database that was accessible to anyone with an internet connection. They also found that the database had been left unprotected for over a year, giving attackers ample time to access and exploit the data.\n\nThe Aipai.com leak is a reminder of the importance of data security. It is essential for organizations to take steps to protect their users personal information from unauthorized access. This includes encrypting data, using strong passwords, and implementing regular security audits.
