In 2017, a massive data breach exposed the personal information of over 348,556 customers from 宜高家居商城, a major home improvement retailer in China. The leak occurred due to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket that stored the customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found the unsecured S3 bucket and alerted the company to the issue. 宜高家居商城 quickly responded by securing the bucket and launching an investigation into the breach. However, the data had already been exposed for several days, allowing malicious actors to access and potentially exploit the information.
