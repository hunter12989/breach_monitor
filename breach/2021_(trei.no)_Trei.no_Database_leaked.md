The Trei.no Database Leak in 2021 refers to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive customer data by a Norwegian telecom company, Trei.no. In February 2021, the company revealed that a database containing approximately 1,644,411 records of its customers had been compromised due to a security breach.\n\nThe leaked data included personal information such as names, dates of birth, addresses, national identity numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses. Additionally, the database also stored sensitive information such as login credentials, password reset tokens, and API keys.\n\nThe security breach was detected on February 10, 2021, and the company quickly notified the relevant authorities, including the Norwegian Data Protection Authority. Trei.no ensured that the affected customers were notified and offered affected individuals a complimentary identity theft protection service for a year.\n\nThe investigation into the breach found that an unauthorized third-party gained access to the database due to a vulnerability in an application used by the company.
