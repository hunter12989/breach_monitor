In 2006, a data leak occurred within 腾讯 (Tencent), a Chinese multinational technology company. The leak exposed the personal information of 411 Tencent employees, including their names, phone numbers, email addresses, and even home addresses.\n\nThe source of the leak was later traced to a Tencent employee who had accidentally uploaded a spreadsheet containing the sensitive data to a public website. The spreadsheet was quickly discovered and downloaded by unauthorized individuals, who then proceeded to disseminate the information online.
