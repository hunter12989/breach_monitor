The Canadian Residential 2011 leak, also known as the CRA data breach, occurred in 2011 when a hacker breached the Canada Revenue Agencys (CRA) systems and accessed the personal information of millions of Canadians. The leak was considered the largest of its kind in Canadian history, with approximately 12,563,782 records being compromised.\n\nThe leaked data included highly sensitive information such as social insurance numbers (SINs), dates of birth, addresses, and income levels. This breach posed significant risks to the affected individuals, as SINs are used for various identity verification and financial transactions in Canada. The leak also potentially exposed Canadians to identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities.
