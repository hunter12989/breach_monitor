In 2019, a massive data breach occurred known as the Quidd Leak. This breach exposed the personal information of over 3.8 million users of the popular mobile trivia app Quidd. The leaked data included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and device identifiers.\n\nThe breach was caused by a vulnerability in Quidds software that allowed attackers to access the companys database. Once the attackers had accessed the database, they were able to steal the user information. The data was then sold on the dark web for criminal purposes.
