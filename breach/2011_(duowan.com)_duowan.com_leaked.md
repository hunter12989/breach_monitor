In 2011, the Chinese gaming platform Duowan.com experienced a major data breach, compromising the personal information of over 8 million users. The leaked data included user names, email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, game records, and even real-world contact information such as phone numbers and home addresses.\n\nThe breach was initially discovered by security researchers who noticed a database containing the stolen information being offered for sale on the dark web. The researchers contacted Duowan.com, who subsequently confirmed the breach and took steps to secure the compromised data. However, a large portion of the data had already been downloaded and distributed before the breach could be contained. The leaked data was widely criticized for its potential to be used for identity theft, fraud, and other malicious purposes.
