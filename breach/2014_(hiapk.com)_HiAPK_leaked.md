The HiAPK leak, which occurred in 2014, compromised the personal information of millions of users due to a flaw in the popular Chinese Android app store. The leak exposed a massive database containing over 138 million records, including sensitive information such as usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, and in-app purchase histories.\n\nThis data breach was significant due to the large number of affected users and the potential for identity theft and fraud. It also raised concerns about the security measures implemented by app stores and the importance of protecting user privacy. The leak prompted investigations by authorities and led to stricter regulations on app store operations and data protection practices.
