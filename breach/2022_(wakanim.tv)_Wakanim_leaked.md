The Wakanim leak of 2022 involved the exposure of 6,706,951 user records from the anime streaming service. The leaked data included personally identifiable information (PII), such as usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko on December 11, 2022, and was confirmed by Wakanim on December 14, 2022. Wakanim stated that the leak was caused by a vulnerability in its third-party customer relationship management (CRM) system, which was used to store user data. Wakanim has since patched the vulnerability and reset user passwords.
