In 2015, MCResolver, a company that provided domain name resolution services, suffered a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of users. The leak occurred due to an unsecured database that was left accessible on the internet.\n\nHackers were able to access the database and steal the personal information of 13,080,237 individuals. The stolen data included names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and even social security numbers. MCResolver failed to properly secure the database and neglected to implement basic security measures, which allowed the hackers to easily access the sensitive information.
