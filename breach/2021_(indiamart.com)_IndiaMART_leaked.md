**IndiaMART Leak of 2021**\n\nIn 2021, a massive data breach at IndiaMART exposed the personal information of over 20 million users. The leak included sensitive data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and even hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach was discovered by a security researcher named Rajshekhar Rajaharia. Rajaharia found that an unsecured database containing the leaked data was accessible online. The database contained records from IndiaMARTs user registration system, as well as information from its e-commerce platform.\n\nThe leak was a major blow to IndiaMARTs reputation and raised concerns about the security of user data in India. The company initially denied the breach but later confirmed it and apologized to its users. IndiaMART also said it was working with law enforcement to investigate the incident.
