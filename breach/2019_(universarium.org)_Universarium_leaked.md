In 2019, a data breach at Universarium (universarium.org) exposed the personal information of 564,962 users. The leaked data included email addresses and passwords, which were stored in plain text.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Vinny Troia, who found a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket containing the sensitive information. The bucket was accessible to anyone with an internet connection, allowing Troia to download the entire database.\n\nThe leaked data was shared on the dark web and was quickly used by cybercriminals to launch phishing attacks and spam campaigns. The breach also raised concerns about the security of Universariums platform and the lack of encryption for user passwords.
