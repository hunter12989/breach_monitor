In 2015, Ancestry, one of the largest online genealogy companies, experienced a significant data breach that compromised the personal information of 297,806 users. The leaked data included sensitive information such as names, addresses, email addresses, and birthdates.\n\nThe breach was caused by a vulnerability in Ancestrys website that allowed an unauthorized third party to access and download the user data. The company discovered the breach in May 2015 and immediately notified the affected users. Ancestry also took steps to strengthen its security measures and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
