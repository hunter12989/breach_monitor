In April 2022, the Moroccan classified ads website Avito.ma suffered a major data breach that exposed the personal information of over 2.7 million users. The leaked data included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. The breach was discovered by the security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found the leaked data on a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) server.\n\nThe leaked data was quickly spread across the internet, and it was used by criminals to launch phishing and identity theft attacks. The breach also raised concerns about the security of personal data in Morocco, as it showed that even large companies can be vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nAvito.ma has since taken steps to secure its website and prevent future breaches. The company has also apologized to its users for the leak and offered them free credit monitoring services. However, the breach has damaged the companys reputation and raised questions about its ability to protect user data.
