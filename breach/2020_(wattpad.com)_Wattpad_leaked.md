In September 2020, the popular online writing platform Wattpad experienced a massive data breach, resulting in the exposure of nearly 270 million user records. The compromised data included sensitive information such as email addresses, usernames, and even hashed passwords, making it one of the largest data breaches in recent history.\n\nThe breach was particularly concerning due to the sheer number of affected users and the potential for malicious actors to exploit the exposed information. Email addresses, for instance, could be used for phishing attacks or spam, while hashed passwords could be cracked using brute-force techniques to gain access to accounts. The breach prompted Wattpad to take swift action, including resetting passwords for affected users and implementing additional security measures to prevent future incidents.
