In 2016, a massive data leak known as the Anti-Public Combo List compromised the personal information of millions of internet users. The leak exposed over 457 million unique email addresses, alongside their corresponding passwords and usernames.\n\nThe Anti-Public Combo List was compiled by aggregating data breaches from various online platforms and services. It included a wide range of sensitive information such as email addresses, passwords, usernames, home addresses, phone numbers, and even Social Security numbers. The list was made publicly available on a dark web forum, where it was rapidly acquired by cybercriminals and spammers.
