In 2020, a massive data breach compromised Webkinz, a popular online pet game for children. The leak exposed the personal information of over 22 million users, including names, addresses, email addresses, passwords, and even childrens birthdates.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who found an unsecured database containing the sensitive data. The database was accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and it had reportedly been exposed for several months before it was discovered. \n\nThe Webkinz leak raised serious concerns about the privacy and security of childrens data. Many parents were outraged that their childrens personal information had been compromised, and they demanded answers from Ganz, the company behind Webkinz.
