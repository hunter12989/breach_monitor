In 2014, the Bitly URL shortening service experienced a massive data breach, resulting in the exposure of 9,313,136 user records. The compromised information included personally identifiable data (PII) such as real names, email addresses, social network IDs, and Bitly links.\n\nThe breach was discovered after researchers at the University of California, Berkeley stumbled upon a publicly accessible MongoDB database that contained the sensitive user data. The database was reportedly misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to the sensitive information it contained. Bitly acknowledged the breach and immediately took steps to secure the database and notify affected users.
