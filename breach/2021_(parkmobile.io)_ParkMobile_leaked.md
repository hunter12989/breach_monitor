In April 2021, ParkMobile, a mobile payment app for parking, experienced a data breach that compromised 20,949,825 customer records. The leaked data included personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, license plate numbers, and transaction details.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researchers at Safety Detectives. They found that ParkMobiles database was publicly accessible due to a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket. The bucket contained a massive trove of customer data dating back to 2013.\n\nThe exposed data could have been used by cybercriminals for identity theft, fraud, and targeted phishing attacks. ParkMobile took immediate action to secure the database and launched an investigation into the breach. The company also notified affected customers and offered them free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.
