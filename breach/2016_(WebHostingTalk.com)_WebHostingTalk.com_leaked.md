In 2016, WebHostingTalk.com, a popular online community for web hosting professionals, experienced a data breach that resulted in the exposure of sensitive information belonging to its users. The leak compromised a total of 576,479 records, including names, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the forums software, which allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database. The stolen data was then published on a dark web forum, putting users at risk of identity theft and other malicious activities. The leak caused significant concern among the affected users, many of whom had used the forum to discuss sensitive business matters and personal information. WebHostingTalk.com subsequently took steps to address the vulnerability and notify its users of the breach. The company also urged users to change their passwords and be cautious of phishing attempts.
