In 2014, the Rambler Group, a Russian internet company, experienced a major data breach that exposed the personal information of over 91 million users. The leak included sensitive data such as:\n\n- Full names\n- Email addresses\n- Phone numbers\n- Birthdates\n- IP addresses\n- Postal addresses\n- Account passwords (hashed)\n- Security questions and answers\n\nThe breach reportedly occurred due to a vulnerability in Ramblers website that allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to the companys database. The leaked information was subsequently published online on a hacker forum, making it widely available to cybercriminals and identity thieves.\n\nThis data breach was one of the largest in history at the time, highlighting the importance of data security measures for internet companies. It also serves as a reminder of the potential risks associated with providing personal information online.
