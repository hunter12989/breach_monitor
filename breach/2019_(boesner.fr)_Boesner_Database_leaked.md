In 2019, Boesner, a German art supplies company, suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of 78,570 customers. \n\nThe leaked data included names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and partial credit card numbers.  \n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket containing the exposed data. Diachenko notified Boesner of the breach, and the company quickly took steps to secure the bucket and launch an investigation. \n\nThe investigation revealed that the breach was caused by a misconfiguration of an AWS S3 bucket. The bucket was publicly accessible, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access the data it contained. \n\nBoesner has since taken steps to improve its security measures and prevent future breaches. The company has implemented stricter access controls for its AWS S3 buckets and has also implemented additional security measures to protect customer data.
