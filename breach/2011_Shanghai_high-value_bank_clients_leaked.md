In 2011, a confidential database containing sensitive information of approximately 208,581 high-value clients of the Shanghai City Bank was leaked. The leaked data included personal details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, account balances, and transaction history. The breach went undetected for an extended period, potentially exposing affected individuals to financial fraud and identity theft.\n\nThe compromised database, believed to be accessed through a vulnerability in the banks system, raised concerns about data security and the protection of customer information in the financial industry. The bank promptly launched an investigation and implemented additional security measures to prevent future incidents. However, the leak had severe consequences for the affected individuals, who had to remain vigilant against fraudulent activities and identity theft while dealing with the aftermath of the breach.
