In 2011, the Civil Online leak, also known as the Civil Code Leak, compromised the personal information of millions of Americans. The leak exposed the sensitive data of 13,499,051 individuals, making it one of the largest data breaches in history. The leaked information included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, drivers license numbers, and criminal records.\n\nThe leak occurred when the website Civil Online, which provided background checks and public records, was hacked. The hackers gained access to the sites database, which contained the personal information of millions of Americans who had used the service. The leaked data was then posted online, where it was accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
