On January 20, 2023, a database leak from JD Group, a South African furniture retailer, exposed the personal information of 500,381 customers. The leaked data included sensitive information such as full names, ID numbers, physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. The breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found the exposed database on a publicly accessible server.\n\nJD Group confirmed the breach and stated that the exposed data was a result of a third-party vendors system being compromised. The company has since taken steps to secure the affected system and has notified the affected customers. The leak has raised concerns about the security of personal data in South Africa and the need for stricter data protection regulations.
