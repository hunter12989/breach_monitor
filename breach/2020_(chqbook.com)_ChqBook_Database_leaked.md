In 2020, a massive data breach occurred at ChqBook, a popular Indian financial technology company, exposing the personal information of over 4.8 million customers. The leaked database contained sensitive information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, and transaction histories.\n\nThe leak was attributed to a vulnerability in ChqBooks website that allowed an unauthorized actor to access and download the database. The compromised data was then shared on the dark web, putting customers at risk of identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities.\n\nThe breach had a significant impact on ChqBooks reputation and customers trust in the company. It also raised concerns about the security of digital financial services in India. The company subsequently implemented additional security measures to prevent such incidents in the future.
