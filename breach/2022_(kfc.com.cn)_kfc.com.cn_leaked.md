In 2022, a significant data breach occurred at KFCs China operations, resulting in the exposure of personal information belonging to millions of customers. The leaked database contained approximately 5,368,000 records, including sensitive data such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and even hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach was discovered when a security researcher stumbled upon the exposed database on a public server. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the database had been left unsecured for an extended period, allowing for anyone with access to the internet to view the information. The unsecured database contained records dating back to 2015, making it one of the largest data breaches in the restaurant industrys history.
