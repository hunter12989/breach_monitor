The GPS Underground leak in 2016 refers to a massive data breach that occurred on the popular gaming forum, GPS Underground. On November 6, 2016, the forums administrators announced that their database had been compromised, resulting in the theft of approximately 657,879 user records.\n\nThe leaked data included usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and a hashed version of users passwords. The breach was attributed to a vulnerability in the forums software, which was exploited by an unauthorized party. The administrators took immediate action to secure the site and alerted law enforcement agencies of the incident.\n\nThe leak was significant not only because of the large number of affected users, but also because of the sensitive information that was exposed. The stolen data put millions of people at risk of identity theft, email hacking, and other forms of cybercrime.\n\nAs a result, GPS Underground took significant steps to upgrade its security protocols and implement new measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. Users were also advised to change their passwords and be cautious of phishing scams.
