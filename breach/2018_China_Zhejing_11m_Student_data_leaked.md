In 2018, the Zhejiang Education Department experienced a massive data leak, exposing the personal information of 11,225,468 students. This leak compromised a wide range of sensitive data, including names, birthdates, ID numbers, addresses, and educational records.\n\nThe leak is believed to have originated from a third-party vendor hired by the Education Department to manage student data. A vulnerability in the vendors system allowed an unauthorized party to access and download the student records. The data was then shared publicly on an online forum.
