In January 2017, the Taringa! database was compromised, exposing personal information of over 27 million users. The leak contained usernames, email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, and other sensitive data. \n \nThe breach was initially discovered by a security researcher who noticed that the database was accessible without a password. The researcher notified Taringa! of the vulnerability, but the company initially downplayed the severity of the leak. \n \nHowever, the researcher subsequently published a blog post about the breach, which prompted a wider investigation. Taringa! eventually confirmed the leak and apologized to its users.
