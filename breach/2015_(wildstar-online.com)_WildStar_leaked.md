WildStar was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Carbine Studios and published by NCSOFT.\n\nIn 2015, hackers gained access to WildStars database and leaked a vast amount of player information, including 742,387 records. The leaked data included player emails, passwords, and security questions, as well as login credentials and character information.\n\nThe hack was initially reported on May 13, 2015, and it is believed that the hackers were able to gain access to the database through a phishing email sent to WildStar employees.
