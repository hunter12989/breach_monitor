In 2014, the online cannabis magazine Cannabis.com suffered a major data breach, exposing the personal information of over 227,000 users. The leaked data included email addresses, usernames, passwords, IP addresses, and other sensitive information.  \n \nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery, who found an exposed database on the magazines website. The database contained the user information in plain text, making it easy for attackers to access. Vickery notified Cannabis.com of the breach, and the magazine quickly took down the database and reset all user passwords.  \n \nThe Cannabis.com breach was a significant reminder of the importance of data security. The magazines failure to adequately protect its users personal information put them at risk of identity theft, fraud, and other cybercrimes.
