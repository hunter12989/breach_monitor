The breach sparked concerns among players about the potential risks of identity theft, phishing, and account hijacking. Gamers were advised to change their passwords and remain vigilant for any suspicious activity.\n\nThe StalkerOnline Database leak serves as a stark reminder of the importance of data security and the need for robust measures to prevent and respond to cyber threats.
