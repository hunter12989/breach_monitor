In 2018, the photo-sharing platform EyeEm experienced a significant data leak, compromising the information of over 19.6 million users. The breach exposed a vast array of personal and sensitive data, including full names, email addresses, profile pictures, and even location data.\n\nThe leaked information was reportedly obtained through a vulnerability in EyeEms database. Attackers exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to user records, potentially putting millions of individuals at risk of identity theft, targeted scams, and other forms of cybercrime. The leaked data was later discovered on a hacker forum, raising concerns about the security measures in place at EyeEm.
