The BookCrossing database leak in 2022 refers to the unauthorized release of personal data from the online book sharing platform, BookCrossing. The leak, which occurred in June 2022, exposed the sensitive information of over 1.57 million users. The compromised data included information such as user IDs, email addresses, passwords, and address book contacts.\n\nThe leak was reported by cybersecurity experts, who discovered the breach while investigating a cryptocurrency scam. The stolen data was found to be contained in a publicly accessible database, which was not properly secured. The database was found to be linked to BookCrossing, a website that allows users to release and track books as they are passed from person to person.\n\nThe leaked data has the potential to cause significant harm to the affected individuals, as it can be used for identity theft, scams, and other malicious activities. BookCrossing has since taken steps to notify affected users and to secure its database. The company has also recommended that users change their passwords and monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of maintaining the security and privacy of user data, particularly in online platforms where sensitive information is collected. It also serves as a reminder of the potential risks associated with using online services and the importance of taking steps to protect personal information.
