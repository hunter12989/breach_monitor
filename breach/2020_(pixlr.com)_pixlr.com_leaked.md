In 2020, Pixlr.com, a popular online photo editor, experienced a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of over 1.9 million users. The leaked data included email addresses, usernames, passwords, and IP addresses.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found an unprotected database containing the stolen information. Diachenko reported the breach to Pixlr, which confirmed the incident and launched an investigation. Pixlr later announced that the leaked data was encrypted, but the encryption keys were also compromised. This meant that the stolen information was potentially accessible to attackers.\n\nThe Pixlr data breach raised concerns about the security of online services and the importance of protecting user data. Pixlr reset the passwords of all affected users and implemented additional security measures to prevent future breaches. However, the incident highlighted the potential risks associated with storing personal information online.
