In August 2018, the Chinese fast fashion retailer SHEIN experienced a data breach that compromised the personal information of over 39 million customers. The leaked data included names, email addresses, hashed passwords, and order histories. \n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) bucket containing the exposed data. Diachenko alerted SHEIN of the breach, and the company quickly secured the bucket and launched an investigation. \n\nSHEIN subsequently notified affected customers of the breach and recommended that they change their passwords. The company also implemented additional security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future.
