In 2018, HauteLook, a Nordstrom-owned online fashion retailer, suffered a massive data breach that compromised the personal information of millions of its users. The breach exposed a database containing 28,510,459 records, including customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and order histories.\n\nThe leaked database also contained sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes. This information could be used by cybercriminals to make fraudulent purchases or steal identities. The breach was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who notified HauteLook of the vulnerability. The company quickly took action to secure the database and notify affected users.
