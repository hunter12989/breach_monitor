The Manga Traders leak occurred in 2014 and was one of the largest data breaches in Australian history. On March 17, 2014, it was discovered that the personal data of 855,249 customers of Manga Traders, a Japanese import store from Melbourne, had been stolen from its database.\n\nThe leaked data included customer names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, password hashes, and credit card details, including card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes. The breach was initially attributed to a SQL injection attack, although the exact method used to steal the data is still unknown.\n\nThe affected customers were those who had purchased from Manga Traders between 1994 and 2014, with the majority of the stolen data being from the 2000s. The breach occurred at a time when many companies were still vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, and it highlights the importance of proper security measures to protect customer data.\n\nThe Manga Traders breach was significant not only because of the large number of affected records but also because of the type of data stolen. The compromised credit card information posed a significant risk of identity theft and financial fraud to the affected customers.
