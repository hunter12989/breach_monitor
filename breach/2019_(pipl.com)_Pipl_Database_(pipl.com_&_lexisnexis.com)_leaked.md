In June 2019, approximately 495 million records from Pipl Database were exposed after a researcher discovered an unsecured Elasticsearch server. Pipl provides data aggregation services, compiling personal information from various sources. The leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social media profiles, and other sensitive information.\n\nThe leak raised concerns about the privacy and security practices of Pipl, which claimed to have industry-leading data security measures in place. The incident also highlighted the potential risks associated with collecting and storing large amounts of personal data. LexisNexis, the parent company of Pipl, was notified about the leak and took steps to secure the exposed server.
