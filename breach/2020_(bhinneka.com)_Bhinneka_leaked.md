The Bhinneka leak, discovered in 2020, exposed the personal data of 2,428,668 individuals in Indonesia. The data breach occurred due to a vulnerability in Bhinnekas e-commerce platform, which allowed unauthorized access to customer information stored in its database.\n\nThe leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and partial credit card details. The breach also compromised the login credentials of 1,752,247 users, putting their accounts at risk of unauthorized access.\n\nThe Bhinneka leak raised concerns about the security measures in place for e-commerce platforms in Indonesia. It highlighted the need for businesses to prioritize data protection and implement robust security measures to safeguard customer information.
