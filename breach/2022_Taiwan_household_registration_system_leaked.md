In 2022, a massive data leak occurred in Taiwan, compromising the personal information of millions of citizens. The leak, dubbed tw户籍分割, exposed 13,775,834 household registration records. This included sensitive data such as:\n\n\n\n\n- Full names\n- Birth dates\n- Addresses\n- Family relationships\n- And other personal details\n\n\n\n\nThe leak was attributed to a security breach at the Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for maintaining the household registration system. The breach reportedly occurred through a third-party vendor that was granted access to the system. The leaked data was subsequently sold on an online forum, prompting investigations and legal action by the Taiwanese government.
