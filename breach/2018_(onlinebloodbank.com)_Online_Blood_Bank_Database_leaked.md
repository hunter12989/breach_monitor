In January 2018, the Indian blood-donating website Online Blood Bank (Previously known as "Odisha Blood Bank") suffered a data breach. The leak led to the exposure of data including Email Addresses (Only 1763), Full names, Dates of birth, Genders, Blood types, Phone numbers, Physical addresses and Donation locations. In total, 1.1 million donors were affected. The data was leaked due to an Administrator of the website leaving a backup file publicly accessible in a directory. The website is now defunct and no longer exists.\n
