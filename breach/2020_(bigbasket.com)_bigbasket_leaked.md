In May 2020, the Indian online grocery store BigBasket suffered a massive data breach, exposing the personal information of over 20 million customers. The stolen database included sensitive information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and order histories.\n\nThe leaked data was discovered by a security researcher who found it available for sale on the dark web. The researcher notified BigBasket of the breach, and the company confirmed the authenticity of the data. BigBasket immediately launched an investigation and took steps to secure the affected data and prevent further breaches. The company also notified the affected customers and recommended that they change their passwords and monitor their financial accounts for any suspicious activity.\n\nThe BigBasket data breach was a major concern for customers, as the exposed information could be used for identity theft, phishing attacks, and other malicious purposes. The breach also highlighted the importance of data security for online retailers and the need for companies to take appropriate measures to protect customer information.
