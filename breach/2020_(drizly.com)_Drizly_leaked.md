In December 2020, Drizly, an alcohol delivery service, experienced a significant data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information belonging to 2,479,044 customers.\n\nThe leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and order histories. It was discovered that the data was being sold on the dark web, putting customers at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other forms of cybercrime.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a vulnerability in Drizlys third-party marketing platform, which was exploited by hackers to gain access to the companys customer database. Drizly promptly responded to the incident, notifying affected customers and implementing additional security measures. However, the breach highlighted the growing threat of cyberattacks on businesses that handle sensitive customer data.
