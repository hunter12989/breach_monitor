On January 10, 2023, a leak of 16,956 records from the Chinese job search website 51job was discovered. The leaked data included sensitive personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and resumes. The leak was traced back to a third-party vendor that was used by 51job to process job applications.\n\nThe leaked records contained information on job seekers who had applied for positions at various companies in China. The leak was a major breach of privacy, as it exposed the personal information of thousands of individuals to potential misuse. 51job has since apologized for the leak and has taken steps to improve its security measures. However, the incident raises concerns about the security of personal data in China, where data leaks have become increasingly common in recent years.
