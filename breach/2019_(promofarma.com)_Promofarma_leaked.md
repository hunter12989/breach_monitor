The Promofarma leak in 2019 was a significant data breach that compromised the personal information of over 1.28 million patients in Spain.\n\nThe breach occurred when an unsecured server stored medical records of patients who visited pharmacies owned by Promofarma, a Spanish retail pharmacy chain. The server was left exposed to the internet, allowing unauthorized individuals to access the sensitive data without requiring a password or any other form of authentication.
