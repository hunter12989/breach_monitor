In September 2022, a massive data leak occurred in Shanghai, China, involving the theft of personal information from a police database. The leak compromised the records of approximately 750,000 individuals, including highly sensitive information such as names, national identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and even criminal history. \n\nThe data breach was attributed to a flaw in a third-party software used by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. The exposed information was then shared widely on the dark web, posing significant risks to the affected individuals. The leak raised concerns about data privacy and the adequacy of security measures employed by law enforcement agencies in China.
