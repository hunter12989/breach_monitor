In 2011, Canadian Business magazine experienced a severe data breach, where the personal information of over 1.3 million customers was compromised. This leak, one of the largest in Canadian history, included sensitive data such as names, addresses, email addresses, and credit card details. The breach originated from a vulnerability in the magazines subscription system, allowing unauthorized access to customer information.\n\nThe leak posed significant risks to the affected individuals, as the exposed data could be used for identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities. Canadian Business immediately launched an internal investigation and notified law enforcement. The magazine also offered complimentary identity theft protection services to all impacted individuals. Additionally, the incident led to an overhaul of the magazines security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future.
