In 2017, the Hilton Hotel chain experienced a major data breach that exposed sensitive information of guests. On March 31st and July 5th, hackers compromised Hiltons systems and gained access to 667221 records. The leaked data included names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and credit card details.\n\nThe breach affected guests who stayed at Hilton-owned properties around the world, including Hilton Hotels, DoubleTree, Embassy Suites, and Waldorf Astoria. Hilton discovered the breach in late July and immediately notified the affected guests and relevant authorities. The company also apologized for the inconvenience and offered free credit monitoring services to those affected.\n\nThe Hilton data breach is a reminder of the importance of protecting sensitive personal information. Companies must invest in robust cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access to their systems. Individuals must also be vigilant in protecting their personal information online and reporting any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.
