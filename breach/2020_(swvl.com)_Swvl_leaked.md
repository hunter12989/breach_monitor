In May 2020, a massive data leak from Swvl, an Egyptian transportation startup, exposed the personal information of over 4.1 million users. The leak included sensitive information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and trip history.\n\nThe data was stolen by an unauthorized third party and sold on the dark web. Swvl was not aware of the breach until it was notified by a security researcher. The company immediately launched an investigation and notified affected users.\n\nThe leak was a major embarrassment for Swvl, which had been touted as one of the most promising startups in the Middle East. The companys stock price plummeted in the aftermath of the breach, and it faced criticism from users and privacy advocates.\n\nSwvl has since taken steps to improve its security measures and prevent future leaks. The company has hired a new chief security officer and implemented new security protocols. Swvl has also partnered with a leading cybersecurity firm to conduct regular security audits.
