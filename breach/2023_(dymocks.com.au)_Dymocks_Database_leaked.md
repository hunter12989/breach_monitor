In 2022, a massive data breach at Dymocks, an Australian bookstore chain, compromised the personal information of over 800,000 customers. The leaked database contained highly sensitive data, including real names, genders, and dates of birth.\n\nThe breach was discovered through a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket, which left the data exposed to the public internet without proper security measures. The leaked information could potentially be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes.
