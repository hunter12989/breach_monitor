In 2020, the popular avatar service Gravatar suffered a massive data leak, exposing the personal information of millions of users. The leak contained over 113 million records, including email addresses, usernames, and MD5-hashed passwords.\n\nThe leak occurred due to a vulnerability in Gravatars API, which allowed attackers to access user data without authorization. The compromised data was then sold on the dark web for a substantial sum, putting affected users at risk of phishing attacks, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime.\n\nThe Gravatar leak was one of the most significant data breaches of 2020. It highlighted the importance of strong security measures and proper data management practices to protect user privacy.
