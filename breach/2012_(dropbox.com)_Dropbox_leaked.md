In 2012, Dropbox experienced a major data leak which exposed the personal information of approximately 68 million users. The leak was caused by a directory listing vulnerability on Dropboxs website, which allowed hackers to access and download user data, including email addresses, passwords, and Dropbox file names. \n\nThe leaked data was made available on the internet and was quickly indexed by search engines like Google. This made it easy for hackers and other malicious actors to access and exploit the personal information of Dropbox users. \n\nThe data leak was a major embarrassment for Dropbox and raised serious concerns about the companys security practices. In response to the leak, Dropbox reset the passwords of all affected users and implemented additional security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
