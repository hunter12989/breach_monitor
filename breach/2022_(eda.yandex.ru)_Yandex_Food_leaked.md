The Yandex Food data leak occurred in March 2022, exposing the personal information of 49,441,686 users of the food delivery service. The leaked data included names, phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, and order histories.\n\nThe leak was caused by a vulnerability in Yandex Foods mobile app that allowed attackers to access its database. The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who reported it to Yandex. However, Yandex reportedly ignored the researchers warnings for three weeks, which allowed the attacker to steal the data and leak it to the public.\n\nThe Yandex Food leak is one of the largest data breaches in recent history and has raised concerns about the security of personal data in the digital age. The leak has also damaged Yandexs reputation and could result in legal action against the company.
