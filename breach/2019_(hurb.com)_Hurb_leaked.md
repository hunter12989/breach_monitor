In 2019, the hotel booking service Houras database was compromised, leaking personal data of over 20 million past and present customers. The exposed data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and credit card information. The breach was discovered on May 23, 2019, and the company notified affected customers on June 12, 2019.\n\nThe leak was significant due to the volume of personal information exposed and the potential for identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. The affected records belonged to customers who had booked accommodations through the Houra website or mobile app. The database also contained information about canceled reservations and unused gift certificates.\n\nFollowing the breach, Houra implemented additional security measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The company also worked with law enforcement to investigate the hack and identify the perpetrators. However, no arrests have been made in connection with the leak.
