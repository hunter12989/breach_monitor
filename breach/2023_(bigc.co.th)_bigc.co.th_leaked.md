In January 2023, a data leak occurred on the website of Thailands largest hypermarket chain, Big C Supercenter (bigc.co.th). The leak exposed sensitive information belonging to 6076 individuals.\n\nThe leaked data included personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. Additionally, the leak contained sensitive financial data, including credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes. This information could be used by malicious actors for identity theft, fraud, or other cybercrimes.\n\nThe leak was discovered by a researcher who identified a vulnerability on Big Cs website that allowed unauthorized access to customer data. The researcher promptly notified Big C of the vulnerability, and the company has since taken steps to patch the security hole. However, the leaked data remains in the hands of malicious actors, and individuals whose information was compromised are at risk of fraud and identity theft.
