The Lookbook leak in 2012 occurred when a hacker accessed the database of Lookout, an antivirus company, and stole over 1074948 email addresses, passwords, and other personal information of Barnes & Noble customers. This massive data breach was not limited to credit card numbers, but included sensitive details such as pure text passwords, security questions, and answers, and even expiration dates of credit cards.\n\nThe hacker, believed to be a lone individual, exploited a vulnerability in the Lookouts mobile app to gain unauthorized access to the companys database. It is alleged that the hacker was motivated by financial gain, and planned to sell the stolen information on the dark web. The stolen data included information of Apple iTunes and Amazon customers, but the majority of the records belonged to Barnes & Nobles customers.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of strong password security, two-factor authentication, and regular data backups. It also underscores the need for companies to prioritize cybersecurity measures, including regular security audits and penetration testing, to prevent such breaches from occurring in the first place.
