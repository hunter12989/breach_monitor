In August 2015, Patreon, a crowdfunding platform, fell victim to a data breach. An unknown attacker gained unauthorized access to Patreons database and stole user data. The breach compromised the personal information of over 2.3 million users, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and encrypted passwords.\n\nThe stolen data was later leaked online, exposing the sensitive information of Patreon users. The leak sparked outrage among users, prompting Patreon to take immediate action. The company reset all user passwords and implemented additional security measures to prevent future breaches. Patreon also notified affected users and offered support to those whose data was compromised.\n\nThe Patreon leak was a major blow to the companys reputation and highlighted the importance of data security. In the wake of the breach, Patreon implemented a number of changes to its security practices, including increasing employee training, strengthening password encryption, and implementing two-factor authentication.
