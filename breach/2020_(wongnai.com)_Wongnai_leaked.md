In 2020, the Thai food review platform Wongnai suffered a massive data breach, exposing the personal information of 4,298,301 users. The leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who informed Wongnai about the vulnerability. Wongnai initially denied the breach but later confirmed it and notified affected users. The company stated that the vulnerability was caused by a weakness in its password reset process.\n\nThe Wongnai data breach is a significant reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. Businesses must implement robust security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Users must also be vigilant about protecting their personal information online.
