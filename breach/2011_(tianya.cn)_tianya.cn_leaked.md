In 2011, the Tianya forum suffered a data breach, leading to the leak of a massive database containing 290,208,08 records. This data included sensitive information such as real names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of users from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas.\n\nThe leak was attributed to a vulnerability in the forums software, which allowed an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user database. The compromised data was then leaked online, exposing the personal information of millions of users. The breach caused widespread concern and outrage, as it highlighted the vulnerability of personal data in the digital age.
