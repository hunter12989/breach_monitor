The NetEase leak in 2015 was a major data breach that compromised the personal information of over 234 million users. The leak occurred when a hacker gained access to NetEases servers and stole a database containing user email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and other sensitive data. The leaked database was later posted online and made available for download.\n\nThe NetEase leak had a significant impact on the users affected. Many of the leaked email addresses and passwords were used to access other online accounts, such as social media accounts and financial accounts. This led to a number of cases of identity theft and fraud. The leak also damaged NetEases reputation and led to a loss of trust among its users.
