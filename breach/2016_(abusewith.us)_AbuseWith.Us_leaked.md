The AbuseWith.Us leak in 2016 referred to the unauthorized release of a large dataset of records containing information about sexual harassment and abuse allegations made by individuals against various public figures. The dataset consisted of over 1.37 million records, which included details such as the accusers identities, the accused individuals, and the allegations.\n\nThe leaked data was purportedly taken from the website AbuseWith.Us, a platform that allowed individuals to anonymously report instances of sexual harassment and abuse. The platform had been created by artist and activist Eine Klein Nachtmusik, who had intended to make it a tool for victims to share their stories and hold perpetrators accountable. However, the database was compromised, and the data was released to the public.\n\nThe leak sparked widespread outrage and scandal, as it revealed the extent of sexual misconduct and harassment committed by prominent figures in various fields, including entertainment, politics, and media. The leak also highlighted the vulnerability of individuals who reported these incidents, as many of the accusers identities and personal information were left exposed.
