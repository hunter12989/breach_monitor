In 2019, a massive data breach was reported at MGM Resorts International, exposing the sensitive information of millions of hotel guests. The attack compromised a database containing approximately 142.5 million records, making it one of the largest data breaches in history.\n\nThe compromised data included personal details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also included more sensitive information such as passport numbers, reservation details, and even room key numbers. The breach affected guests who had made reservations at MGM Resorts properties, including Bellagio, Mirage, and Excalibur, between 2017 and 2019.\n\nUpon discovering the breach, MGM Resorts notified law enforcement and launched an investigation. The investigation revealed that the attack was likely carried out by a sophisticated hacking group that gained access to the database through a third-party vendor. MGM Resorts has since implemented additional security measures to prevent such attacks in the future.
