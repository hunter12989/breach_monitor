In January 2023, a massive data breach at China UnionPay (CUP), the countrys largest bank card operator, exposed the personal and financial information of 10,000 customers. The breach involved the leak of customer names, identification numbers, card numbers, and transaction history.\n\nThe leaked data was found on an unsecured Elasticsearch server, which is a popular search and analytics engine. This server was accessible to anyone with an internet connection, allowing the unauthorized access and retrieval of the sensitive customer information. It is believed that the breach was the result of a security misconfiguration, allowing an unauthorized person or group to access the server.
