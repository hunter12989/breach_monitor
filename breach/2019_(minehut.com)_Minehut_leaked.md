In 2019, Minehut, a popular Minecraft server hosting platform, suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of 396533 users. The leaked data included sensitive information such as email addresses and passwords, putting the affected individuals at risk of identity theft and other cybercrimes.\n\nThe breach was reportedly caused by a vulnerability in Minehuts website that allowed unauthorized access to the companys database. Once the attackers gained access, they were able to steal the user data and make it publicly available online. The leak was discovered by security researchers and reported to Minehut, who subsequently took steps to patch the vulnerability and reset the passwords of all affected users.
