The Artsy leak in 2018 was a significant data breach that exposed the personal and professional information of at least 1,079,831 individuals. On October 13, 2018, an unauthorized third-party actor gained access to Artsys database, containing sensitive information such as names, email addresses, job titles, and professional affiliations.\n\nThe leaked data also included information about art collectors, dealers, and institutions, including their interactions with Artsy, such as email exchanges and online activity. This type of information can be valuable for hackers to engage in credible spear phishing attacks, compromising the security of those affected.\n\nArtsy, an online platform for buying, selling, and discovering art, took swift action to remediate the breach by notifying affected individuals, informing them of the measures taken to secure their data, and offering free credit monitoring services for a year.
