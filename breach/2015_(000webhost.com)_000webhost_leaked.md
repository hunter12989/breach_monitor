The 000webhost database breach was a significant cybersecurity incident that occurred in March 2015, though it only came to public attention in October 2015. 000webhost, a free web hosting provider, experienced a data breach that resulted in the leak of personal information of approximately 13.5 million of its users. This information included names, email addresses, and plaintext passwords, which is particularly concerning given the lack of encryption on the passwords. \n<br>\nThe breach was first discovered by an anonymous hacker who reportedly exploited a vulnerability in 000webhost\'s old, outdated PHP version to gain unauthorized access to the company\'s systems. The incident highlighted the dangers of inadequate cybersecurity measures and the importance of regular software updates. \n\nFollowing the breach, 000webhost took several actions to address the issue, including resetting all user passwords, updating their system software, and urging users to change their passwords, especially if they used the same password on other websites. This event served as a wake-up call for many in the web hosting industry about the critical need for robust security practices.
