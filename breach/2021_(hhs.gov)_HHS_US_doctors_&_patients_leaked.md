In June 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) experienced a major data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of Americans. The breach was caused by a flaw in the HHSs data handling system, which allowed an unauthorized party to access and download a large database containing the records of over 6 million people.\n\nThe leaked data included a wide range of personal information, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdates, and medical histories. The breach also exposed the personal information of over 1 million patients who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. The leaked data was quickly made available for sale on the dark web, and it is believed that the information was used by criminals to commit identity theft and other forms of fraud.\n\nThe HHS data breach was one of the largest and most damaging data breaches in U.S. history. It exposed the personal information of millions of Americans and put them at risk of identity theft and other forms of fraud. The breach also raised serious questions about the HHSs data security practices and its ability to protect the personal information of the people it serves.
