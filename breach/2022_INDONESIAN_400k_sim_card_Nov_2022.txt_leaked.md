The leaked data included sensitive information such as full names, national identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n\nThe leak was traced to an unnamed Indonesian cellular provider and is believed to have occurred due to a security breach of their customer database. The leaked data was then sold on a popular hacking forum, making it accessible to malicious actors.
