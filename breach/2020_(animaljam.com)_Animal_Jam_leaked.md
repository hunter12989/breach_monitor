In 2020, Animal Jam, a popular online multiplayer game, suffered a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 7.1 million users. The leaked data included names, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach was first discovered by security researcher Justin Paine, who found a publicly accessible database containing the stolen information. Paine immediately notified Animal Jam, and the company quickly took steps to secure the database and investigate the incident.\n\nThe Animal Jam leak was a significant security breach that raised concerns about the safety of online user data. It also highlighted the importance of strong security measures and user privacy. Animal Jam has since implemented additional security measures to protect user data, and the company has also apologized to affected users.
