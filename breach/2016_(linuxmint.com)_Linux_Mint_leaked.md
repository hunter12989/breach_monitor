In 2016, Linux Mint experienced a data breach, resulting in the leak of 144,989 user records. The compromised data included usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe leak was discovered after malicious actors gained unauthorized access to the Linux Mint website and installed malware to capture user login information. The attackers then uploaded the stolen data to a remote server.\n\nThe breach was initially detected by a security researcher and reported to the Linux Mint team. Linux Mint promptly alerted its users, advised them to reset their passwords, and initiated an investigation to determine the extent of the leak and identify the responsible parties.
