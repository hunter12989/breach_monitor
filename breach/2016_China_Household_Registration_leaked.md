In 2016, a massive data leak exposed the personal information of over 983 million Chinese citizens. The leak included household registration records, which contained sensitive information such as names, addresses, birthdates, and family relationships.\n\nThe data was stolen from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and was subsequently sold on the dark web. The leak exposed a vast trove of personal data, making it one of the largest data breaches in history. The Chinese government responded to the leak by launching an investigation and cracking down on dark web marketplaces.
