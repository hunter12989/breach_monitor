In early 2023, a massive data leak compromised millions of WeChat user records. The leaked data included personally identifiable information such as WeChat IDs, phone numbers, and other sensitive details. It is estimated that over 300,130,000 records were exposed in the breach.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researchers who identified a vulnerability in WeChats API. The vulnerability allowed attackers to access user data without authorization, and they subsequently exploited it to collect and distribute the leaked information.
