In 2022, a massive data breach exposed sensitive health records of nearly 101 million Turkish citizens (\\u20ac100,923,784) from the Halk Sa\\u011fl\\u0131\\u011f\\u0131 Y\\u00f6netim Sistemi (HSYS) database. The leak included a wide range of personal and medical information, including names, addresses, national identification numbers, diagnoses, medications, and even genetic data.\n\nThe breach was discovered in April 2022 by a security researcher known as Bob Diachenko. Diachenko found an unsecured database exposed online, accessible without a password or other security measures. He contacted Turkish authorities, who confirmed the breach and took the database offline.\n\nThe HSYS database leak is considered one of the largest healthcare data breaches in history. The exposed data could be used for identity theft, medical fraud, or even targeted attacks on individuals based on their health information. Turkish authorities launched an investigation into the breach and pledged to hold those responsible accountable.
