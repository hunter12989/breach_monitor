In 2020, Teespring, a popular e-commerce platform for custom apparel and accessories, experienced a data breach that exposed the personal information of over 8 million users. The breach was discovered in April and involved an unauthorized access to Teesprings database, resulting in the leak of sensitive data.\n\nThe exposed information included names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and order histories. Additionally, some users had their payment information, such as credit card numbers and expiration dates, compromised. The breach was particularly concerning as it affected a large number of users and exposed highly sensitive data.
