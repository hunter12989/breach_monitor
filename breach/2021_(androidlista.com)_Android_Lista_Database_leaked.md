In October 2021, a massive data leak from the Android Lista database exposed the personal information of over 6.6 million users. The leaked database included email addresses, phone numbers, names, and device identifiers, making it one of the largest data breaches in recent history.\n\nThe leak was a result of a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket, which allowed anyone with the correct URL to access the database. The leak was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who immediately notified Lista of the issue.
