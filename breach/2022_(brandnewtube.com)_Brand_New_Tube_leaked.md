In 2022, the Brand New Tube (BNT) forum experienced a massive data leak that exposed the personal information of 349,627 users. The leaked data included email addresses, usernames, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who shared the data with Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), a service that helps users check if their email addresses have been compromised in data breaches. HIBP confirmed the authenticity of the leak and notified affected users.\n\nThe BNT leak was particularly concerning because the forum was known for hosting illegal content, including pirated copyrighted material and child sexual abuse material. The leak raised concerns that the stolen data could be used to identify and target users who had accessed such content.\n\nFollowing the leak, BNT shut down its website and forum. The forums administrators apologized for the breach and advised users to change their passwords and take steps to protect their online security. However, some experts believe that the damage may have already been done, as the leaked data could be used by cybercriminals for identity theft, phishing scams, and other malicious purposes.
