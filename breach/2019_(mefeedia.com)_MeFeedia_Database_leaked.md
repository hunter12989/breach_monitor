On March 31, 2019, a massive dataset of approximately 1,644,359 records was leaked online. The database belonged to MeFeedia, a company that provides media monitoring and analysis services.\n\nThe leaked data included a mix of public and private information about individuals, celebrities, and organizations. It contained details such as names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and IP addresses.
