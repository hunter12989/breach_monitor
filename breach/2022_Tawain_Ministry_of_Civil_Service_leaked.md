In 2022, the Ministry of Civil Service in Taiwan suffered a significant data leak, exposing personal information of over 589,000 individuals. The leaked records contained sensitive information such as names, identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. This breach was considered one of the worst data leaks in Taiwanese history.\n\nThe leak originated from a vulnerability within the Ministrys internal systems, allowing an unauthorized actor to gain access and exfiltrate the data. The exposed information put individuals at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities. The Ministry acknowledged the breach and launched an investigation, but the impact on affected individuals remains a concern.
