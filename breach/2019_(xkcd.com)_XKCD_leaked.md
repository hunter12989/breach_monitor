In 2019, XKCD, a popular webcomic, experienced a security breach that exposed personal information of 561,991 users. The stolen data included sensitive information such as email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, and password hash values. The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the XKCD forums, which allowed an attacker to gain access to the database containing user information.\n\nThe leaked data was shared online, potentially putting users at risk of identity theft, spam, phishing scams, and other malicious activities. XKCD responded to the breach by resetting all user passwords and issuing a security advisory to users. They also notified affected users and recommended they take steps to secure their accounts and personal information.
