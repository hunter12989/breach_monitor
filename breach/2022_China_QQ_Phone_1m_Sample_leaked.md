In April 2022, a massive leak of 1,000,000 records from QQs user binding system was discovered. The leaked data included QQ user IDs, email addresses, and other sensitive information. This leak posed a significant privacy risk to affected users, as their personal data could be used for malicious purposes such as phishing attacks or identity theft.\n\nThe leak originated from a vulnerability in QQs user binding system, which allowed attackers to access and download user data. The vulnerability was exploited by an unknown group of individuals, who then sold the leaked data on the dark web. The leak was discovered by security researchers, who notified QQ of the breach. QQ quickly patched the vulnerability and launched an investigation into the incident. However, the leaked data has already been widely distributed and could continue to pose a risk to affected users.
