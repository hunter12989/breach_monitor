In 2018, Romwe, an online fashion retailer, experienced a significant data breach that compromised the personal information of over 19 million customers. The leaked data, which was sold on the dark web, included sensitive information such as names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThe Romwe leak also exposed customers purchase history, credit card numbers, and other financial details. The breach was attributed to a vulnerability in Romwes website that allowed hackers to access its database. The company has since taken steps to improve its security measures, but the leak remains one of the largest retail data breaches in recent history.
