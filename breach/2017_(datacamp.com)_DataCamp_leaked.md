In 2017, a data breach at DataCamp, an online learning platform, exposed the personal information of over 760,000 users. The leaked data included names, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords.\n\nThe breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the platforms code that allowed an unauthorized party to gain access to the user database. DataCamp later acknowledged the breach and reset the passwords of all affected users.
