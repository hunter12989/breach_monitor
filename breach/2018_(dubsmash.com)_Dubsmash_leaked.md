In May 2018, a massive data leak exposed the personal information of over 161 million Dubsmash users. The compromised data included email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, and profile pictures.\n\nThe leak was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who found the data exposed on an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket. The data was allegedly stolen by a hacker who exploited a vulnerability in Dubsmashs API.\n\nThe leak raised concerns about the security of Dubsmash and other social media platforms. It also highlighted the importance of protecting personal data, especially in the wake of increasing data breaches.
