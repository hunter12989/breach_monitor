In July 2022, Instagram faced a massive leak that exposed the data of over 170 million users. This leak included a database of sensitive information such as user profiles, email addresses, phone numbers, and biographical data.\n\nThe leak was first discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who found a misconfigured database on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that contained the stolen data. The database was left unsecured and accessible to anyone with an internet connection, making it a major privacy concern for Instagram users.
