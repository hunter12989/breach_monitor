In September 2020, LimeVPN, a popular VPN service provider, suffered a data leak that exposed the personal information of 19,853 users. The leak was caused by an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket that contained unencrypted user data, including email addresses, usernames, billing information, and payment data. The leaked data was accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and it was subsequently indexed by search engines.\n\nThe LimeVPN leak was a major privacy breach and it raised serious concerns about the security of the companys services. LimeVPN has since taken steps to secure its infrastructure and prevent future leaks, but the incident has damaged the companys reputation and raised questions about the trustworthiness of its services.
