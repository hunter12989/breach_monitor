In 2022, a major data breach occurred at DiskUnion Database, a Japanese music retailer. The leak exposed the personal information of 702,666 customers, including their real names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and addresses.\n\nThe breach was discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt, who found the data for sale on the dark web. The leaked data was highly sensitive and could be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes. DiskUnion Database has since apologized for the breach and is working to improve its security measures.
