In 2019, Avvo, a legal marketplace, experienced a data breach that exposed the personal information of 12,500 attorneys and 4,101,101 individuals. The leaked data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other sensitive information.\n\nThe breach was caused by an unsecured database that was mistakenly exposed to the public internet. It was discovered by security researchers who alerted Avvo to the vulnerability. Avvo quickly took down the database and notified those affected by the breach.\n\nThe Avvo leak was a significant privacy breach, and it raised concerns about the security of online legal marketplaces. In the wake of the breach, Avvo implemented new security measures to protect user data.
