In 2022, the personal information of over 120,000 customers was leaked from a well-known fried chicken restaurant chain in Taiwan. The leak was discovered when a third-party researcher found a publicly accessible database containing the stolen data. The exposed information included names, phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, and in some cases, even credit card numbers.\n\nThe restaurant chain quickly launched an investigation and confirmed the breach. They notified affected customers and offered free credit monitoring services. However, the leak raised concerns about the security measures in place at the restaurant and the potential for identity theft and other fraudulent activities. The company apologized for the breach and pledged to strengthen their security protocols to prevent future incidents.
