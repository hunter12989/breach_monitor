In April 2021, a significant data breach occurred, affecting Fortnite, a popular online battle royale game developed by Epic Games. The breach, known as the Fortnite Porn Database leak, exposed a massive collection of users records, totaling 76,469 entries.\n\nThe leaked data included sensitive information such as:\n\n\nusername, \n\n\nemail address, \n\n\npassword hashed with the PBKDF2 algorithm, \n\n\ndate of birth, \n\n\ngender, \n\n\nlocation, \n\n\nand a unique identifier.\n\nThe breach is believed to have originated from an insecure database owned by a third-party company that created an online resource for accessing and sharing Fortnite-related content. The hacked database contained user data obtained through the online resources registration process, where users could create an account to share and access Fortnite-related materials.\n\nThe exposed records did not include payment information or any financial data. However, the leaked records can still pose a significant risk to affected users, particularly those who use the same login credentials across multiple websites or services. As a result, it is essential for users to change their passwords immediately and consider two-factor authentication to enhance their online security.
