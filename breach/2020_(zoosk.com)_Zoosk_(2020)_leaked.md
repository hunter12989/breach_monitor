In February 2020, a massive data leak affected the online dating website Zoosk, exposing the personal information of millions of its users. The breach compromised a database containing over 239 million records, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and sexual preferences.\n\nThe leaked data was uncovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, who discovered it on an unprotected Amazon S3 bucket. The bucket was publicly accessible, allowing anyone with an internet connection to download the exposed information. Diachenko notified Zoosk of the breach, and the company secured the bucket and launched an investigation.\n\nThe Zoosk data leak raised concerns about the privacy and security of online dating platforms. It highlighted the need for companies to take appropriate measures to protect user data from unauthorized access and disclosure. Zoosk was criticized for failing to adequately secure its database and for the lack of transparency surrounding the breach. The company ultimately settled with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for $1.3 million over allegations that it violated consumer privacy laws.
