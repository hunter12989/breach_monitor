In 2015, R2Games user database was hacked and leaked, exposing the personal information of over 22 million users. The leaked data included usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and hashed passwords. The breach was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Grossman, who notified R2Games of the vulnerability.\n\nR2Games initially denied the breach, but later confirmed the incident and issued a statement to its users. The company stated that it had taken steps to secure its systems and prevent future breaches. However, the leaked data has continued to circulate online and has been used in phishing attacks and other malicious activities.
