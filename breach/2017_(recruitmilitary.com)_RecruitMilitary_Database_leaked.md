Here is a summary of the RecruitMilitary Database leak in 2017:\n\nIn 2017, a massive database leak occurred when RecruitMilitary, a company specializing in job placement services for military veterans, exposed over 850,934 records containing sensitive personal and professional information of veterans, reservists, and retirees. The database leak was caused by the compromise of a third-party vendors server, which stored recruiter contact information for the company.\n\nThe leaked records included names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, job titles, and branch of service information. Additionally, the leaked data also included some Social Security numbers, although it was unclear how many were affected. The compromised data was reportedly stored on a server without adequate security measures, allowing hackers to access and download the sensitive information.\n\nThe leak was first reported byematics, a data security company that detected the breach and alerted RecruitMilitary. The company subsequently notified the affected individuals and took steps to secure the compromised server. The incident highlighted the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and data protection practices, particularly for companies handling sensitive information.
