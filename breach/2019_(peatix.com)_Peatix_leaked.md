In 2019, a massive data breach exposed the personal information of over 6.7 million users on the Japanese event management platform, Peatix. The leak, discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt, comprised a database of user records dating back to 2013.\n\nLeaked data included email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, genders, occupations, and event participation history. While financial information was not compromised, the breach posed a significant privacy risk, as exposed email addresses could be used for phishing attacks or other malicious purposes.\n\nThe leak was attributed to a vulnerability in Peatixs user authentication process. The company has since taken steps to address the issue and has notified affected users. However, the breach highlights the importance of strong cybersecurity measures and the need for individuals to protect their personal data online.
