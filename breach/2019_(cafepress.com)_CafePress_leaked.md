In February 2019, CafePress, an online print-on-demand marketplace, suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of over 23 million customers. The leaked records included names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and order histories.\n\nThe breach was caused by a vulnerability in CafePresss checkout system that allowed hackers to access customer data. The hackers exploited the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to CafePresss database and extract the customer records.\n\nThe CafePress data breach was one of the largest data breaches of 2019 and raised concerns about the security of personal data held by online retailers. CafePress notified affected customers about the breach and offered them free credit monitoring services. The company also took steps to improve its security measures to prevent future breaches.
