In March 2021, a massive data leak exposed personal information of over 615,000 COVID-19 vaccine recipients in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nThe leak, which included names, addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data, was discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko and reported to the Indonesian government. The data was reportedly stolen from Indonesias Ministry of Health and was later found for sale on a hacker forum.\n\n\n\nThe leak raised concerns about the security of Indonesias healthcare infrastructure and the potential for the exposed data to be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes. The government launched an investigation into the breach and pledged to take steps to improve security measures.
