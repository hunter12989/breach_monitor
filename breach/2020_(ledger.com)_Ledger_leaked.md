The Ledger leak in 2020 was a significant data breach that exposed the personal and financial information of over 1.07 million individuals. The breach involved the theft of a database from a Serbian cryptocurrency exchange, Ledger, which contained sensitive information including \n\nnames, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of clients.\n\nThe leaked data also included cryptocurrency trading records and financial information, such as bank account numbers and credit card information. The hackers obtained access to the database through an unknown vulnerability in Ledgers systems. The incident was detected in May 2020, and Ledger immediately notified affected users and began investigating the breach.\n\nAnalyzed by computer security experts, the exposed data showcased how easily hackers can obtain sensitive information by exploiting weaknesses in online systems. The rapid spread of the news and the severity of the breach created significant alarm for cryptocurrency users and led to a renewed focus on cybersecurity for online exchanges.\n\nIn response to the breach, Ledger vowed to improve its security measures and reimbursed the affected users for potential losses. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust security measures in online transactions and the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges.
