In 2015, a major security breach at Comcast exposed the personal information of its customers. The leak affected over 616,000 Comcast.net email accounts, compromising their email addresses, passwords, and physical addresses.\n\nThe breach was caused by a vulnerability in Comcasts website that allowed hackers to access customer data without authorization. The leaked information was later found for sale on the dark web, putting the victims at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, and other cybercrimes.\n\nThe Comcast breach was a significant event that highlighted the importance of protecting personal information online. It also prompted Comcast to invest in additional security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
