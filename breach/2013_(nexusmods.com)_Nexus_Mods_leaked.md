In 2013, Nexus Mods experienced a severe data breach that exposed the personal information of its users. The leak, which affected over 5.9 million records, included user email addresses, usernames, IP addresses, and encrypted passwords.\n\nThe breach was caused by a security vulnerability in the Nexus Mods website. Exploiting this vulnerability, attackers gained unauthorized access to the sites database and stole the user information. The stolen data was then posted on a public forum, where it was accessible to anyone.\n\nThe Nexus Mods leak had significant consequences for affected users. Many users had their email addresses and passwords compromised, making them vulnerable to phishing attacks and other forms of cybercrime. Additionally, the leak of user IP addresses raised concerns about potential doxing and harassment.
