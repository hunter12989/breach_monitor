In 2015, a massive data breach occurred when an ISO file containing the personal information of 458,155 Nintendo Wii U users was leaked online. The leak included sensitive data such as names, addresses, email addresses, and dates of birth.\n\nThis breach was particularly significant due to the volume of records exposed and the nature of the information compromised. The stolen data could be used for identity theft, phishing scams, and other malicious purposes. It also raised concerns about the security measures implemented by Nintendo to protect user data.\n\nThe leak was attributed to an SQL injection vulnerability in Nintendos website, which allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to the companys database. Nintendo responded to the breach by taking down its website and implementing additional security measures to prevent future attacks.
