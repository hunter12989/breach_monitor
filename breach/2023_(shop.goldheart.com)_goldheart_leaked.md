In February 2023, a data breach occurred at Goldheart Jewelry, exposing sensitive information of approximately 41,980 customers. The leaked data included personal details such as names, addresses, email addresses, contact numbers, and dates of birth. Additionally, some records revealed order details, including jewelry purchases, amounts spent, and transaction dates.\n\nThe breach is believed to have originated from a third-party marketing vendor that Goldheart had contracted. The vendors systems were compromised, allowing unauthorized access to Goldhearts customer database. Goldheart promptly launched an investigation and notified affected customers, advising them to change their passwords and monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.
