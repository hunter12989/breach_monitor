In 2013, Tumblr suffered a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of its users. The leak, which compromised over 65 million records, included sensitive data such as email addresses, IP addresses, and passwords. The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the platforms password reset system, which allowed attackers to access user data without requiring their passwords.\n\nThe exposed data was reportedly sold on the dark web, leading to concerns about identity theft and other forms of online fraud. Tumblr responded to the breach by resetting user passwords and implementing additional security measures. The leak had a significant impact on user trust and raised concerns about the security of online platforms.
