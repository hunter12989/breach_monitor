\n The Banorte database leak in 2014 was a significant data breach that occurred on September 23, 2014. Banorte is a major Mexican bank with over 18 million customers.\n\n\n\n As a result of the breach, over 2.1 million records were leaked, containing sensitive information such as names, dates of birth, national identity numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The leaked data also included financial information, including bank account numbers, credit card numbers, and transaction records.\n\n\n\n The affected records primarily consisted of individuals and businesses in Mexico, although some records belonged to foreigners who used Banortes services. The leak occurred due to a vulnerability in a third-party application used by the bank, which was exploited by an unauthorized party.\n\n\n\n The breach was significant not only due to the large number of records leaked but also because of the sensitive nature of the information compromised. As a result, Banorte was forced to take measures to notify affected customers, provide credit monitoring services, and enhance its security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future.\n\n\n\n The incident led to widespread concern about the security of financial data and highlighted the need for banks to prioritize data protection and cybersecurity.
