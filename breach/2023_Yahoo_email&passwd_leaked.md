In July 2023, a massive data breach at Yahoo exposed the personal information of millions of users. The compromised database contained 5386368 records, including email addresses and passwords in plaintext format. This leak is particularly significant as Yahoo is one of the largest email providers worldwide.\n\nThe source of the breach is still under investigation, but it is believed to have originated from a third-party vendor that Yahoo had hired to manage its user data. The leaked database was discovered and published on a popular hacking forum, making it easily accessible to cybercriminals.
