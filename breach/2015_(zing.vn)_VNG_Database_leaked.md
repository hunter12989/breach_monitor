In 2015, a massive database leak from Vietnams largest telecommunications company, Viettel Network Group (VNG), compromised the personal information of over 161 million individuals. The leaked data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles. This breach was one of the largest data leaks in Vietnamese history and raised significant concerns about the security of personal data in the country.\n\nThe VNG database leak sparked widespread outrage and led to an investigation by the Vietnamese government. The investigation revealed that the leak was caused by a security vulnerability in VNGs website. The vulnerability allowed attackers to access the companys database and exfiltrate the personal information of millions of Vietnamese citizens.
